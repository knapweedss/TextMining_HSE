I love ASOS and allCustomer service they are just adorable
"My order was left outside and the school kids ransacked it, however this was hermes who had left it outside and ASOS refunded me and resolved my issue immediately, Mairi was so kind and helpful. 10/10 customer service."
Helpful and friendly staff.
Replied quickly and made sure their customers were happy
"Rebecca was patient and helpful with my queries, though there seems to be some logistic issues with ASOS delivery. I've only received 1 out of the 4 parcels that were deemed to be delivered on the same day."
"Fast, kind, clear answer! Perfect that I love ASOS service"
"It took over 20 minutes to be connected with the online chat service. Upon waiting for the chat to commence, it then took 18 minutes for the customer assistant to respond with an answer to my query, which was also very unhelpful. Overall the service was poor when comparing to other online chat services."
"Terrible firm. I had such a bad time trying to get them to deliver that I won't use them again. Unfortunately I forgot to tell my wife, watching her go through the same pantomime . How does this firm stay on business ?"
"very helpful, clear and prompt"
"Ordered a Vivienne Westwood which was delivered on time but  arrived sealed but with no watch inside!  Christmas stress!  After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats. ASOS so far, so good!"
Terrible Paid for next day delivery and I still haven’t received it 4 days later and no one is replying to my emails or telling me where my parcel is
Excellent and easy.
"Renee at Asos was very friendly and professional. My issue was resolved in 15 minutes. Even though the delivery of my purchase is delayed, I still felt that the customer support is great."
Items ordered on 1/12 on standard 3-5 day delivery. Got estimated delivery date 11/12. Dispatch 9/12 still no parcel. Contact ASOS who won’t do anything until they speak with currier. Speak to Currier directly says parcel returned due to damage. ASOS won’t accept this for 48hours and now say I have to wait a further 7 days to see if they receive my parcel back and then maybe issue a refund which will take another 7-10 days DO NOT BUT FROM THESE IF YOU’D LIKE TO ACTUALLY GET THE GOODS YOU PAID FOR
Terrible experience. Courier left my parcel in a gas metre and my parcel was unsealed. One whole outfit from my order was missing and no order info or returns label inside. I complain on FB so ASOS send out a replacement parcel... to an old address I don’t live at anymore! Why on earth would you do that? Wouldn’t common sense tell you to send the parcel to the address of the original order??? I’m absolutely foaming and want my money back. Absolutely useless.
No customer support at allLeave your messages unresponded for weeksDelivery takes 2-3 weeks!Unbelievable Never again
I had issue with the delivery of my order and spoke to melanie on Live. She was very helpful and sorted everything out for me.
My issue remains unresolved and I have been referred to a specialist team who are unable to give me a timeline.
"had an issue with delivery, but was sorted on line quickly."
Awful experience. No help at all. Will never use asos again
So polite and helpful.
One star as they helped me with my issue well but the to be waiting so long for someone’s gift to come and to be told it’s lost and the item is now out of stock is horrible. So close to Christmas i’ll fail to get a replacement in time
"The only reason I am giving a rating at all is because Bethani on chat was helpful in responding to my complaint. I placed an order for Xmas presents and the order was sent back by yodel with no explanation. I now have to wait up to 3 weeks for a refund. Until ASOS change delivery partner, I shall not be buying again."
After waiting over a long period of time but I guess it’s a given with the time of year. But after getting through to a agent she was really helpful and quick at getting a resolution.
Really helpful and easy process
All Asos customer service providers are very professional and helpful
"good customer service, very thorough and quick to deal with any situation.However, should not be delivering through a horrible courier service, Hermes is a disgrace"
Excellent customer service - responded straight away to my query.  Spoke with Jaime who was incredibly helpful.
Advisers really helpful  just frustrating you have to wait upto 3 - 5 days for an outcome.
I have had a very negative and stressful experience. One of my orders was cancelled and just never arrived so I chased up Asos and finally a replacement order was sent as there was some issue with it apparently. Then when I returned some of the items in my order I did not receive any refund information. I have spent couple of weeks waiting and then sending multiple emails to Asos customer care with no reply. I understand that this is a busy time but I have basically been ignored. I had wanted to do my shopping online to save time and make it easier but it has just been a negative and stressful experience. If I had not kept trying to sort the refund I don't think I would have ever recieved one. I have shopped online many times at Asos but am very upset and disappointed with the service now.
Excellent communication service.
"French website is completely broken. It reloads all the time, doesn't store the shopping cart. It always forgets who you are.It's impossible to buy anything. It""s even impossible to write to tell them. It always goes back to ""hey, first time here!"".I like the design of their products. The front end of their website is great too. But they should fire their entire backend team because it's costing them their Christmas sales."
"Jae! Thank you so much for being understanding of my issue, I was so devastated to hear that my ASOS parcel was ripped & half the items were missing. However, a replacement was offered and would arrive before Christmas so I am extremely happy with my service!! I appreciate your help so much. Thank you :)"
Boyin was very nice over chat and answered all my questions.
Jass was very attentive and helpful. I was in a panic and they really made sure I was given the best service and option possible. Thanks Asos!
Poppi was quick to adress my issue and was great.
Thank you boy in for great customer service very patient agent and helpful.
best company ever
Lesley was so amazing!! She was so understand to the situation I was in and did what she could to help me out. I feel very lucky to have been placed with her. She is seriously the best customer service employee I have ever been in contact with!! Truly as asset to your company!!
Very helpful.
Great service
"Ordered 9 items, the most expensive item wasnt even in the bad which i got given and it had already been opened, how amazing is that? 7 of the items were either wrong item, wrong colour or wrong size. Only 1 item is what i asked for. Absolutely dreadful decision to order for black friday."
"I just finished speaking with Sapphire regarding an order that's a little delayed & it was superb. Sapphire was so helpful, extremely personable, really kind & helped me with the information I needed in no time at all. Great customer service every time from ASOS. Thanks again."
"ASOS customer service is always there to help. The chat works well!However, via email, not so good!"
"Excellent customer service and the representative, Sabrina was so helpful!!."
very prompt replies and very helpful. answered every question i had.
"It was great, I had no problems"
Quick and very helpful!
Have been looking for a reliable company to invest in the bitcoin mining sector/forex and binary options and I have lost over $17k in different fake websites until I met Mr Allan it’s been hell but since the past few weeks have been able to recover upto $14k and I’m gonna be fine soon so I’ll 💯 recommend him to anyhow who sees this.. you can reach him on Instagram @beee_trades and on WhatsApp +18034630467
"I ordered a variety of items from asos on 29/11/19 and recieved my delivery on 09/12/19. I kept the items that were suitable. 4 items were sent back on 10/12/19 at 13:47. 3 items had been selected for a refund and 1 was requested for an exchange. I recieved an email today at 16:57 stating all of the items had been refunded, which I did not want. I first attempted contact around 7pm but had no luck. I recontacted Asos at 23:08 explaining the occurrence to the unhelpful Marta. I was given this - 'I’ve had a look and can see that we still have the jacket in stock – I’m sorry we weren’t able to replace this for you. It could be that none were available when we went to replace your order, which is why we weren’t able to replace it for you' then this 'as the refund has already been accepted by your bank, we're unable to send a replacement.The refund was processed on 13th December. Please allow up to 10 working days for the money to appear in your account. If you'd like, you could place a new order for the jacket and I'll refund your delivery charge. After you've received your shipping confirmation email, just reply to this email with your new order number - and we'll arrange your refund.' I think offering me free delivery was a terrible option, considering it is a mistake on their part. I mentioned I didn't see why I should be paying the now full price for an item where I had asked for it to be exchanged when it was a mistake on their part. Along with wondering if they had my form to view this error on their end. I got offered a 20% voucher, still not good enough when the item was 30% less and I didn't make an error they did. I opted for their exchange service which they have not honoured. I was then given another sad response 'We would only be able to offer a 20% code. The jacket could have been out of stock at the time, in which scenario we would refund you, but may have come back into stock.I'm not able to get your form, this would be at our warehouse.' The availability of this item in the size I have wanted has consistently been available every day since I sent the item back as that is what the website is still currently showing. I asked for this to be escalated as the outcome was not satisfying as I reiterate they have made the error. I was told it would not be escalated as the sales have ended. What does that matter? An escalation was my request. What I was finally left with... 'I completely understand, however the refund has been accepted by your bank and the price has changed so all I could offer is a 20% goodwill gesture.*my response*[23:25:49] What u are offering isn't enough[23:25:57] I didnt ask for a refundASOS[23:26:10] As I'm not able to help further and I've already given you a 20% promo code, I'll close the chat.[23:26:11] ASOS have ended the chatI think this is a real sign of a company trying to manipulate you to spend more on an item they offer exchanges regardless of being bought in the sale. The mistake is from their end and I am clearly being fobbed off with a good will gesture than a solution. Avoiding this being escalated is truly unprofessional."
Very helpful and patient
"Very helpful, and professional.   Helped me get my problem fixed very efficiently."
"Boyin was very helpful, thank you."
Asos Costumer Service is first class.They are able to check every problem and sort it out in few minutes.
I would thank Selina for the good help and fast responses But if you could only change the delivery company Thanks!
Boyin was very helpful in helping to sort out my refund that had not been processed yet.
Never got back to me regarding my problem. 3 months and still haven't had an answer nor refund. Appalling customer service. Now there is no live chat available.
"Sapphire is very helpful,  solve my problem  good experiences with her ."
Jerrome was very helpful and quickly solved my problem. I will be continuing as a customer who recommends your service and customer care
Helpful and very polite
"Dani was very patient and understanding. She helped me resolve my missing order. Asos, in my opinion, has the best customer care service and with 24/7 access!"
Abbas was a great help
very nice service
"Good products and service. I love ASOS because of their regular promotion. However, the refund is getting way too long. It used to be very good. Recently they have changed the policy. It says it can take 30-45 days. But it took me more than 2 months to get refunded. They also did not email me if they received my item or not. I kept wondering if the courier lost my parcel. I had to contact customer service to ask about my refund."
"Yusuf quickly resolved my delivery woes and was able to accommodate a quicker shipping method since the order was lost. Thanks, Yusuf!"
"slow, incomprehensible, rude at times, repetitive, extremely predictable, unhelpful, unnecessaryYou only good working for the Greek gov - thank you!"
"I used to be a loyal customer, I even purchased their premier delivery for one year because I purchase many many things from here but from now on never am I going to order more from them again!!!!My order placed since Black Friday have not reached me yet. It has been 2 weeks!!! The tracking link is useless as it does not show any update at all. I emailed them, contact via Facebook and live chat numerous time but all I got is the radio silent!!!!!! No sign of my items but my money was sure as hell deducted from my bank. This is ridiculous. I am really disappointed!!!! This is beyond ridiculous at this point"
"Kamran Was SplendidHad a problem of my own making with an order to ASOS....tried their online chatline help...after a short wait, connected to Kamran who understood my problem quickly and clearly.  Waiting for reply with positive expectations....Kamran was splendid"
"Absolutely awful! Placed order for two items black Friday and received email that order was received. Didn't arrive on delivery date of 11th December, which was a long time to wait anyway. Online chat 13th December told me the order had failed and been cancelled but they hadn't told me this and the order still showed as due in my app. One item was then out if stock and they wouldn't honour the black Friday prices on the other. They offered only a 10% discount. I asked for express delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they refused. Awful service and no customer care at all. I'm spending my money elsewhere"
"nice and simple to sort out, ONCE I finally got to speak to someone!"
A+++++++++++++++
LAUREN ROCKSShe was so helpful and empathetic and did not give me the run around
Best customer care ever. Very helpful and kind.
I have just spoken to Jade and she has been a pleasure to deal with. She was very helpful and answered my queries professionally which is very reassuring.
"Perfect service, very easy communication, pleasant experience!"
"I have had a problem with my Delivery where Hermes stated the parcel was delivered, but I  did not receive a parcel. Darcy was very helpful sorting a replacement for me over Live Chat. Quick and easy fix :) just waiting on my replacement now."
Azeem kindly helped me resolve the issue. He was so knowledgeable and professional as well. I have been your customer for years and I am always pleased with the way you treat your customers.
"This is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever received in my life. An error was made by ASOS, and the customer care team will not resolve it, despite there being an easy and clear solution. Each response is from a different person, some of whom have clearly read the previous messages and understand the situation, and others who clearly have no idea what’s going on."
"SENT ME A USED SHIRTI know this sounds absurd...but I literally captured it on camera, and instead of my boots, I received a WORN IN, USED shirt with HAIR on it, and I also received new children's pants...like what?! I have returned my items for a refund because ASOS customer service denied me any compensation or anything for their mistake and instead, didn't refund me on shipping, made me go through this whole process...even though I received completely the incorrect order. Honestly, I contacted them on every platform and their response rates were awful, and they were rude as well. I have never been treated so poorly by a company. I had fine experiences with ASOS before, so I thought I could trust them...but this one AWFUL experience outweighs them all. please please dont trust ASOS.Also im looking to write a review straight on the website on the item I purchased and they dont offer reviews per item....THERES A REASON...be cautious"
"This company just wants your money. They don't offer exchanges, so be cautious of ordering items with a promo. They won't honor it if you need to buy a different size. Lewis and Sara both failed to help me and presented awful customer service for the company. Really bad first experience."
"Lewis who helped me have me more information on my order than the carrier was able to, great customer service!"
Nice customer service from Rebecca.
Connor was very helpful and understanding of my frustration. Promised to take action and provide feedback.
The person I spoke with via live chat was very helpful and was able to resolve my problem quickly and effectively.
Great service!
Very efficient. Thanks
Asos customer service is absolutely terrible. They do not reply to customers
Azeem was very helpful great guy!!!
Swift Feedback
Been waiting 2 WEEKS for my delivery and still don’t have itShocking
"Straight to the point, very good service."
Darby was so helpful and kind and I am grateful for her help
"Somewhere between the asos depot and my house in glasgow over half my items were stolen out the asos bag. Asos resolved this situation so quickly and informed me all items that weren't received would be replaced and sent out FOC to me within 4 days. Great service, thank you! I do hope they find out exactly where my items were stolen!"
Take days to respond and provide no solution
"Excellent help, quickly resolved."
"Cr#p customer service. No item received and also used myhermes to send the parcel, who is also one of the worst delivery companies in existence. No contact possible with either company. Definitely avoid both companies and any other company hiding behind email with no phone number to call if there is a problem."
Ella was quick on its answers and gave me a good solution for my problem.
Their customer service has me ripping my ******** hair out. I have been messaging them for the last 10days about a missing delivery and we still haven't got past the security questions. Every couple of days i get a message asking another single question.. answer.. 2 days later another question.. answer and so on.Why not just ask me them all at once if you're so busy.Save yourselves the pain
"I would prefer to speak to someone on the phone, but did find Darcy very helpful and resolved my issue quickly. Thank you."
Great help. Very helpful and quick.
"Great costumers support ....Very helpfully and pleasent.I felted i been take care very fast and kindly I must addmit i have been surprised by the way he handle meMany tnx And keep up the good work , and the good mans you hire thereHe was great i felt good after the chat"
"Very helpful Morgan, this is why customers come back to asos ;0"
"I've order here about 5 times-- bad experience every time. I always cave each holiday as it seems like the go-to place to shop and everyone seems to rave about it. Any item I've ordered is always either poor quality or defective. Thin material, sizing has always been off, and colors often are different from what is pictured. Going through customer care is the real nightmare though. It takes weeks to get a refund back. They have a policy that says once they receive it at the warehouse, the customer has to wait 10 ADDITIONAL days for them to ""process it at the warehouse"". Still, after the 10 days I've had to contact them to initiate the refund. They rarely get back via email so it's better to use the live chat feature on the website. All together, just a horrible experience each time. Never worth it. Never have had so many bad experiences at one online retailer."
Very helpful and quick response
very polite service! Company face is its staff. Asos has it nice.
She took her time and was patient with me! Very pleasant as well.
Excellent and quick service
"April was so polite, and quick and quick to help me with a refund for items that were misplaced from my latest shipment!"
"Had a great experience with Leighann. He was clear, concise, and speedy in finding a solution to my return/refund problem."
Great help to me! :)
Fran from customer service is the only person who had helped me in months!
He is nice and fast helper.
"Have been experiencing several delays with deliveries in the last year or so, not just around peak periods such as Christmas. My latest order was never despatched and it took for me to get in touch to ask after it (after 4 days of no ‘next day’ delivery) to find out that it wasn’t on its way as per the email from DPD and two of the items were now out of stock. Other available items to be re-sent but no guarantees on when they will be despatched or delivered either and no compensation for delays. Really poor service."
very helpful!
Have been using ASOS for years and have always been pleased with their customer services - response and ability to help resolve issues is great.
Tamara helped me in a quick and convenient manner. She was very polite and helped me get the result I needed. Excellent very happy thankyou.
Very helpful
I buy from Asos all the time.And have done for a few years.I love the  wide selection they have. And can always find something that i really love.They are A brilliant company to deal with.Delivery is fast and reliable.They always keep you updated with Emails.Well done Asos you are fantastic.MERRY CHRISTMAS to you all.
Very Helpful
Courtney was very helpful and provided a speedy response.
Naeem was awesome! To the point and fast!!! Thanks u!!!
"After working with several people to get this issue sorted out, Amy was the first person to solve the problem. Thank you Amy!"
"Did not listen to my delivery issue or make an attempt at resolving. Left the issue up to me to wait and/or deal with. I selected shipping locations specifically based on the expected shipping dates listed at time of order. I did not type in or print the shipping labels of your products, why am I left to deal with the mess?"
Rebecca was very helpful and patient!
"Awesome, great customer service"
was helpful and kind BHAVESH
Sara was helpful and quickly gave me the refund I needed. The online chat was much quicker and efficient than the Facebook messenger chat if tried to use earlier.
Asos were very swift and efficient with the solving of my problem.Thank you
"Very few negative experiences. Just wish that there could be much less plastic involved and a stricter policy on production, and it's really putting me off ordering unless I need something desperately last minute."
Rebecca was very helpful and responded quickly.
"Order was never shipped after almost three weeks of waiting. After trying to contact customer services on live chat on several occasions, I got through to someone who said the order had not been shipped. Therefore I could either have a refund or a 'replacement' order. When I asked if I could just reorder the original items, I received unclear and conflicting responses. Throughout this whole order, I received no correspondence from ASOS about my order being cancelled/lost/never shipped, so if I didn't contact them, I would have essentially lost over £150 worth of items. Currently awaiting refund but terrible service throughout"
"Amazing job, Morgan! Thank you !!!"
Great service on getting refund
The experience was fast and easy. Thanks to CHELSEA
"Good,  just a bit slow with returns which is a shame"
The absolute dream.
very helpful. speaking to a person was very useful. tried to do it through hermes and all i got was a unhelpful automated chat.
"Dwayne was very efficient,polite and helpful!"
Responded quickly and efficiently.
Effortless conversation and immediate response & support from the agent! Glad you care for your consumers this much!
"Quick response, clear answers."
Carlo was very helpful
"Live chat was super useful. Courier said my parcel was delivered when it wasn't, asos assitant issued a replacement. Excellent service."
Javeria was extremely helpful and despite the confusion with different orders on my part Javeria was very polite
"The service was excellent, not only did I get a reply straight away but they then helped me sort the issue out , great help !!"
my guy Callum a legend
"ASOS Customer Care are very good. They are happy to help, and very friendly."
Very kind. Good assist
I'm normally so happy with Asos. I recieve orders quickly and it all goes to plan. But they obviously can't handle the demands of black Friday as everything I ordered then still hasn't been delivered. I've emailed and messaged and hardly had a response (I got one email back telling me to wait longer). Then finally got onto chatting about my order with someone only to be told all they could do is refund me or try and re-create the order - but only if the stuff was still in stock. Really disappointed with how much they failed over the black friday period.
Spoke with Paige to enquire about a refund. My klarna hasn't been updated as of yet even though the parcel has been returned to ASOS for about 10 days. Paige quickly and promptly helped with the situation and updated the payment for me. Thank you Paige! :)
"The customer service was unable to give a credible reason to why my account was blocked and also was unable to get me to the right team needed in order to get my concerns resolved, and finally they were unable to provide a telephone number to speak to a manager or supervisor. Very useless customer service in 2019."
Helpful understanding prompt and
Great service
Very friendly & fast processing
Excellent customer service.
she is very helpful
The customer adviser did not have all the information it needs to resolve issues. no certain time line was given until i receive an answer.
Louise tried her best to assure me about a hopeless situation:)
Chloe was great. Solved my problem straight away.
Things always don't go to plan and when orders gives you lemons ASOS make lemonade
"Helpful assistance from Talia. If anything, an alternative solution to my problem could have been suggested earlier on in the conversation as had to probe a little to get the result needed. Good to know what kind of solutions can be offered if possible (I found a solution on Twitter)"
paige was very quick and nice also fun
"I would have given a lower ranking if not a customer care representative DWAYNE, who was friendly and helpful. He promised to resolve the issue."
"Adie, Chloe and Gillian was so kind and helpful! It was a pleasure."
Very helpful
Terrible so-called customer service. They just go in circles around the clear solution. Offering everything but appropriate solutions to issues caused by them. This is the 5th time i’ve had to complain via twitter and they’re not so understanding. Better off directly calling  them as they’re less likely to be so ignorant
Super helpful
"After ASOS cancelling my order unbeknown to me, due to “technical issues” , I contacted customer services and the lady Bethani was super helpful. She was kind, understanding and was able to resolve the issue easily offering me a discount code, meaning I am to be able to replace the order in time for Christmas! Cheers ASOS!"
"Jamie was very quick to respond, very helpful. solved my issue straight away."
Very helpful and straight to the point
"The customer service chat service is awesome in that it allows us to chat with them and directly ask them questions, I feel that it is better than calling services as sometimes it gets very complicated and the waiting time is really long and inefficient. The customer chat service is very helpful and friendly and it solved my queries."
"The service was great and kind throughout the whole conversation. It took some time to wait for a reply however, I didn't mind since I was doing something on the side while waiting. Overall, great experience! Keep it up :)"
I've just been assisted by Ravika and had a really nice experience. Got answers to all my questions and hopefully in a few days my issue will be solved!
"great custumer service , issue resolve as soon as possible"
"Chelsea is very helpful to my order issue, i was not happy with what happened to my order but she helped me solve the problem. very friendly and talented agent"
Jordan was quick and efficient. top job.
Great service from customer support! Items were missing but live chat help was v helpful! Thanks Paige!
I spoke with Chelsea on the chat about my missing return. She was quick with her responses and very helpful. We had all my queries resolved within 10 minutes! Fantastic service - thanks Chelsea
Disappointing!
Thank you for helping me ASAP
"Worst worst worst customer service I had yesterday!! I ordered from ASOS on the 3rd of December and chose the next day delivery option. Haven't got any update since from them and have been contacting customer service daily using chat online. Their service was so rude, advicing me to wait until end of each day and if there isn't any progress to contact back in the next day!! I have to apparently wait until the end of 4th working day AFTER MIDNIGHT to contact for a possible refund. But I chose the NEXT DAY DELIVERY OPTION!! The worst bit of the whole experience is I was told off that there is nothing they could do to advice as it was MY FAULT THAT THE LATE DELIVERY BANNER WAS POSTED ON ASOS ON 28 NOVEMBER 2019. I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD READ BEFORE I ORDER IN THE FUTURE. The customer service analyst was also very eager to close the chat and was very sarcastic throughout the conversation. Poor poor service!!"
"Friendly efficient and helpful! Thank you so much, great service"
I have used ASOS on multiple occasions and never had an issue and the one time I have their customer service was very helpful
Great service!
Margot was nice but it impossible to get to the Chet ! Please try to make it easier for us!
Good service
Quick and amazing customer service from Poppie!!
"More than help my order did not come in for my upcoming trip. As this was my first experience with ASOS, it was extremely frustrating but Gwenne helped me promptly and effectively. 5 stars for customer service but 3 for the lack of attention to orders."
"It took about 15-20 minutes for a single reply, and an hour for a simple problem. Not happy with the chat because it took way long like emails. But in the end i got what i needed done i guess. I love the clothes here but the service was poor."
CLARASSA has quick response and very helpful
"I placed an (expensive) order, and FedEx never delivered it! I was expecting to have to fight tooth and nail for a refund or replacement, but Dani was so kind and helpful in getting the order replaced for me. I’m still waiting for the replacement order to be delivered, but the process of getting my issue resolved was so painless, I had to write a review."
Very helpful and sorted out quickly
What's going on with Delivery times.  Ordered 4 items 5th December which I have only received 1 confirmation email and delivery days is 17th December!!!! 12 days Not good enough ASOSI won't be ordering from you again because of this.
Selina was helpful :)
I unfortunately recieved a wrong item after waiting long time for delivery!! This is the first time i deal with ASOS & it’s not acceptable at all!! I was waiting the jacket for a special occasion &ultimately i was so disappointed!
Boyin is great and friendly. Able to help my issues.
"Amazing choices and styles. May be expensive but are worth the price. Sizing can be confusing sometimes but free returns makes up for it. Wish you could review on the website to get an idea of the products and sizing, otherwise, the website is easy to use and informative."
Marta was really prompt and helpful. thumbs up!
"Ordered over 2 weeks before we needed the dress delivered. It was supposed to be to us by Dec 4th. We needed it by Dec 14. When it didn’t come on the 4th we messaged to find out what they could do and they told us we had to wait until after 10 pm on the 10th. There hadn’t been updated shipping info since November 30. It was clear the package was missing but they didn’t seem to care. Instead they just said sorry we don’t actually care that you didn’t get it and we can’t get it to you by the 14th. If they had done something about it the first time we messaged them, they could have fixed the problem but it seems that ASOS doesn’t care about customers. After all that I’ve had to email and message 4 times to get them to process a refund."
Thanks for spending your precious time with patient to read my texts and emails!
Wish I could leave 0 stars. Awful service. Placed an order and had an email to confirm they were very busy but to be assured my order was being dealt with. Never received order confirmation and after a few days I checked on my account and it had an estimated delivery date. After a couple of weeks I had a despatch email but never received the item. A few days later I had an email confirming I had returned the items. I was charged and Asos had my money the entire time with no intention to deliver the items. The items have gone back up in price since. I will not shop there again and would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not reply to you. They just dont care. Avoid at all costs
"Customer service is excellent, love it"
Marta was the best
Thank you Abbas for your quick and efficient help and for being so nice!
"Honestly I cannot fault the customer service, it’s phenomenal. Auspost lost my parcel during a redirection, as this has Christmas presents in I was at a loss at what to do! I contacted ASOS via Facebook messenger and they got back to me super quick. Told me to contact by end of day to see if the parcel had arrived, it hadn’t. Was asked if I wanted a refund or reorder, chose the reorder. Items reordered, some out of stock so automatically refunded the money straight away. Not only did they replace the items available but they were sent courier express and I’ve received them!!! This all was sorted within 4 business days!!! That’s the UK to Australia! So so happy with the service I received."
Great experience even though I had an order issue. Agent was pleasant and helpful. She took care of my needs. Thank you Sapphire 😁
This was one of the best customer service experiences I've had in a long time. Took care of me when I never received my order!
good customer service
Brilliant costumer service didn't get one of my items I had ordered talked to someone on live chat and it was sent out as a replacement straight away
Was quick to resolve my issue - thank you!
"Aasha was very polite, helpful and responded quickly to all my questions. Great service. Thank you."
upset about the poor quality never again will i order even my vans shirt is bad quality
"The last two people I chatted with were helpful. However, I chatted with three other people who weren’t helpful at all. Asos’ costumes service is terrible for US at least. I would never recommend this to a friend and a one star is an over statement for me. They are secretive and wouldn’t tell you something that the next person you chat with will."
"Jae on live chat with ASOS (13/12/2019) 00:31am ish, was fantastic!!"
I had to give 4 stars due to the package that was lost in transit. But I was helped by Mr.Toby in customer service for my delivery issues. He helped get a refund for the shipping cost and reordered all the items that I had previously purchased. I am very pleased with the customer service and I hope to get the package without any issues.
The person that dealt with me treated me like royalty treated me like how a woman should treat a man loving and caring thank you clarassa xx
Yusuf was very helpful clearing up my problem today..
Helpful advice and quick to respond
solution offered wasn't fair nor clever
"I've been a longtime customer of ASOS and this was my first time seeking assistance through the customer service text chat. I connected with Liam, who provided excellent service. He was extremely courteous, efficient, and was able to answer my questions in a prompt manner. I highly recommend shopping on ASOS for trendy styles at a reasonable price point and awesome customer service!"
I have been on chat with your previous colleagues and got no-where.. gwenne is very understand and assured my problem would be dealt with straight away.. I am happy with the customer service I have received today
really helpful and quick!
Quick and easy with no complications.
Super super - Hanim saved the day!!! so glad
I had an issue with an order and it was fixed right away. Love this app.
"Yusuf was quick in arranging a replacement for the faulty t-shirt I received, Asos customer support service 5 stars as always"
"Absolutely appalling customer service I ordered 3 tracksuits on the 29th November, finally order came on the 10th dec only for me to open it and someone else’s order is in the box!! I’ve paid £70 for tracksuits and received a novelty Christmas tie, socks, a book and drawstring bag!!!! I’ve tried to contact via Facebook messenger and email and had no reply. I have ordered from ASOS previously in the year and never had any issues but this is ridiculous."
Liam was very prompt and helpful with a delivery mishap regarding my order!! Thanks so much for your help!
"I have tried every single contact method possible to get in touch in regards to my order, which the company took TWO WEEKS to notify me was not in stock.On Facebook messenger I have received no reply, I waited in a queue to live chat for 2 HOURS, then gave up.I emailed them and got a bounce back saying their mail box was full and please email another time.Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE to just take your money and provide no support when there is an issue.Appalling service."
"I messaged you almost a week ago asking for help and you only get back to me today? This is appalling customer service. I’ve always ordered from ASOS for years and the one time I need help from you to assist me with something, you give it 6 days later. The “typically replies within a few hours” is a lie on your Facebook platform. I’m really not happy with this and you’ll probably do nothing to change your approach in the future, I guess this is just how you help your customers now."
Completely understood everything thank you
Great swift customer service
Guy was really friendly and v helpful. asos chat help never fails to succeed and actually help :))
it was simple and easy to get in touch with a customer service rep via the online chat feature.
Sapphire was very helpful and helped me get my returns query resolved in a quick manner. Thank you so much once again!
Had an issue with my parcel being delivered which doesn’t usually happen. Harry on the online chat was very helpful and sorted this out straight away. It’s very appreciated
Really nice chatting and helpfull
Worst customer service I have ever received. Appalling.Doesn't even deserve 1 star but can't give none!
"Thank You for helping me and being patient, I really appreciate it."
Devarna was very helpful and quick to respond with thorough answers.
"It has been a week since the conversation started, days have passed in between responses.I still have not had a direct answer to my question, ridiculous customer service."
Leighann was very helpful in answering my concerns regarding my missing items from my order and quickly scheduled a replacement to be sent.
Great services
"I ordered a parcel 17 days before a holiday, in the week previous I contracted them several times via Facebook, Twitter and a phone call for there employees in which I got no help whatsoever, after being promised it would arrive on a certain date by server all different people it didn’t and was three days late than it was promised. Awful experience,  o have been a loyal customer for over ten years and have found the staff very rude and the people not helpful at all. DO NOT BUT FROM THIS OVER PRICED AND UNHELPFUL COMPANY"
"It took 3 days for customer service to get back to me, and when they did the information given was unhelpful. I ordered a pair of shoes, was sent the completely wrong pair, and by the time customer service got back to me the shoes I wanted originally were sold out. The only option I was given was to return the wrong pair for a refund, but nothing about the fact that the shoes I ordered are out of stock. I sent a follow up message detailing my frustrations and have not gotten a response. That was 4 days ago. I feel like the responsibility is on me to fix asos’ mistake and I am not being helped or compensated at all."
Always ok if they use dpd for next day delivery ... Hermes however is hit and miss - sort them out ASOS !!
"I really love the idea and merchandise of ASOS, but their customer service is horrible.  I love how they have a wide range of clothing type like wide shoes, clothes for petite women and larger breasts.  They have sales and promotions but screw you over in the fine print when you need to return something.  Stay away from buy a certain amount and get a certain amount off.  And their sales rep get very smart with you too.  Just be careful when you buy and think about if you really want to go through the hassle if anything were to happen."
"My order had an issue with being shipped however, it was taken care of quickly and with no hassle! I would say chat is the best way to get a hold of them for sure."
"Would give ZERO stars! Absolute joke of a customer service team. Package was due for delivery, never appeared, when I asked what was happening was brushed off before eventually being told it was actually being sent back to ASOS for no reason and basically ‘tough luck’ if you want them again you can reorder but you’ll need to pay full price, despite buying them in the Black Friday sale. Was ignored when I asked to speak to someone on the phone rather than just over twitter. Some of the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced."
Customer service NEVER gets back to you when you have a problem. Terrible experience and worst company. Sent multiple emails AND tried reaching out through messenger and this was several times several weeks ago.
Love asos! I use it all the time. They do so many different brands you can always find what you’re looking for!
"Was really enjoying shopping on Asos, but then on the 11th of December, when it was due to arrive nothing came. It’s the 12th and there is no sign of anything and they aren’t responding. I placed my order on the 30th of November and the didn’t bother to shop it till yesterday which tells me why. Won’t respond and can’t track my order. After seeing reviews where they waited weeks, I’m nervous because I have a party I need the clothes for.... will not be using again stay away from ASOS"
"Customer service is usually very quick and responsive, any issues are resolved in a timely manner. I have premier delivery and normally it comes next day, only time I am kept waiting is when they use Hermes delivery. The clothing is a mixed bag due the variety of brands etc."
quick and simple
"Placed an order that has not been dispatched, delivered and I can’t get a refund."
"Customer service has always been great and the range of sizes and fits (petite, tall, plus etc) are awesome."
Feedback for Rem. Very efficient in dealing with my delivery problems.
"Got an item with a fault (a stain). Spoke to Charlotte on Live Chat, and she was lovely, and arranged for a free replacement :) Would absolutely reccomend - good value, good service, good times :D"
"Good customer service, easy to get a hold of via chat and quick to fix issues, however this is the second order I've made in a couple of months where the parcel has been delivered damaged and items have been missing. This time it was a box that was gaping open and last time the bag had rips in it. Not great, but I'm not sure if it's Asos's fault or the delivery company."
"Truly wonderful service, very personable and even helped with my outfit situation! Loved her, Thanks again Miheala <3"
"Truly wonderful service, very personable and even helped with my outfit situation! Loved her, Thanks again Miheala <3"
"The worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I have been a customer of ASOS for a long time, having made many orders. On Monday, they used DPD to deliver my parcel. DPD left my parcel in an unsafe place, which i did not ask them to do. This led to my parcel being stolen and I am now out of pocket. I emailed ASOS on Monday for them to review this. I emailed their Care inbox, but received a bounce back saying their inbox was full. I then emailed Nick B, their CEO. So far, I have had no response. I then messaged them on Facebook on Tuesday and still, no response. I have had a few friends also complain to ASOS recently about wrong items being delivered and they have gotten no where with their complaints team. Asos seem very quick to apologies but are reluctant to offer any help or compensation."
"I had a good chat with Mihaela, as i have been waiting for a delivery for over a week, she was helpful"
I’m a regular customer of Asos and I enjoy the next day delivery service . I have a daughter with a disability so it great we can order on line and get the next day delivery . However at Xmas it’s total chaos ! I expect there to be delays etc but when my items did finally arrive they had sent me someone else’s order . When I attempted to speak with their customer service ( no phone  option ) I was placed in a huge queue for 45 minutes to be told they would try and refund but it will take time. Etc They need to employ more staff for the Xmas period . Don’t order if you want anything in a hurry
Quick and helpful response ❤️
"Rebecca was amazing, provided fast and quick customer service. Made it an enjoyable experience."
Parcel late and parcel damaged upon arrival. ASOS ‘customer services’ completely disinterested. Order sent back and will never be ordering from ASOS again
very helpful
"I ordered a coat on the 28th november and chose standard delivery as it said i would recieve it on the 2nd december which was fine as i needed it for my holiday on the 6th. I recieved an email sating they were busy and i would recieve a confirmation email soon. I recieved the email at half 1 in the morning and the delivery date had changed to the 9th so i called them the next morning and they said due to black friday they had to extend the delivery date. I asked them to cancel it as i needed it for my holiday which they said they couldnt do as i could only cancel an hour after placing the order even though it wasnt despatched. The package was despatched on the 6th and has been with hermes now since sunday, the 9th has been and gone and we are now on the 12th. I called and spoke to asos on rhe 11th who advised i needed to wait 4 days till they can offer a refund. Having just got off the phone to them they have advised i was given the wrong information and i had to wait 7 days after the delivery date. Very unprofessional if you ask me, they are quick to take your money but not quick to give it back when its their mistake. Will never order from asos again!!!"
"Ordered a parcel on 28 November. Estimated delivery date was 9 December! It's now 12 December and no communication from them or updated delivery date. Come on ASOS, sort it out."
"I placed a standard delivery on my ASOS account nearly two weeks ago.I have called them several times letting them know that one of the items ordered if to be worn to a funeral.Still this didn’t move them to hurry my ordered. They then dispatched my order December 11th to be delivered by December 12th estimated delivery.The irony is that Hermes has my order but from the tracking it won’t be delivered today.Just don’t shop with ASOS!!! Bad, bad and more bad.Useless!"
Charlotte was very helpful in sorting out my query and advised me what steps to take in returning a faulty item as i have never had to do this before.
I ordered a Nike hoodie for my daughter and the item was delivered to someone other than me and I sent ASOS CUSTOMER CARE an email and the would not help me out. I gave them my order number and they are asking me to send them another email from I have no idea where. So now I'm out 60.00 and a hoodie for my daughter . Don't shop from here people. They don't care if you recieved your package or not.
"Terrible customer service taking 6 days between responses via messenger. Then, the response is ignorant to the original points raised. Shocking customer service."
Timely and informative response! Thank you Emily for your support with my query
"Always had a great experience with ASOS, every time I need to know where my parcel is they’re always there to answer and it makes me less stressed! I’m definitely a a loyal customer and have made hundreds or orders, and never had a bigger problem than a day late delivery. Love love love them!"
Rebecca is great! The Chat assistant service is seriously awesome! Thanks ASOS and Rebecca.
Great help and advice A+
She is very understanding and responds quickly
"VERY helpful, courteous and fun....answered all my questions with good advice...problem solved!!!  Thank you Joanna :)"
HERMES advised item was delivered (it wasnt). Sophie on chat was very helpful and is arranging for a replacement.
Good support
Fast response and well has fast problem solving. Friendly staff that are happy to help with any questions and problems.
Had a rather difficult time tracking a return until I've got through to April on the online chat. She made a struggle of two weeks get solved in 5 minutes. Amazing customer service and very lovely.
Natika helped resolve my issue quickly and efficiently.
I have NEVER had a bad experience with ASOS. Whenever I have contacted customer service (about faulty clothes or missing returns) they have always been absolutely amazing.
"I had an issue with a return, spoke to someone using ASOSlivechat and my problem was resolved super quickly.Excellent service"
Amy was really helpful!
"Be aware of your account being closed without notification or explanation. An online shopping site which offering free postage and return but then terminate service to customer due to return frequency? I had made thousand dollars of purchasing before getting deactivated without notice, then chasing after their customer service and being terminated time to time during the chat when I need to sort out the return for my last order (which has not been delivered yet and can no longer be lodged a return from my account). I don't think anyone deserve to be humiliated this way when you pay money for a service. ASOS need to learn their lesson. If you can not afford a sale or a service such as free postage or free return, DO NOT offer it."
live chat service much better than facebook messenger. Sorted my issue in minutes compared to a week waiting for a reply
They were no help at all!!
Not the best online store to shop at. Be sure to figure out all of the promotions you are given before ordering. As they might only tell you after you received your items. If the form fit properly be prepared to pay for the customs charges and return fees.
"Order NO.:454615035Madelaine DI love shopping at ASOS and buy clothes from them at least once a month. While I have rarely ever had issues with the clothes , recently the customer service has been awful. They have introduced Facebook messenger and the waiting time is crazy. I accidently put my old address down for my order and I have no idea where the TrakPak depot is, the local post office say they don't have it but here in Melilla there's no other site. I got no answer about the depot from ASOS despite stating that it's time sensitive . so it looks like all the items I bought in the sale will be returned, great!"
Excellent customer care from Kris.
"Had an issue with my delivery, they refunded me straight away and was lovely. Such helpful customer service, really pleased. :-)"
"Send a live chat on the 1st December letting them know I couldnt apply the 25% off offer code on their website had no response, wrong items have been sent and nobody seems interested to get this resolved! worst customer service team to date.Never get replies always in a ""que"""
Customer care helped alot.I just want you guys to also give option for courier services other then postal service for delivering parcels that would be a great too...Thanks for helping me out.
Very Helpful!
"I had to wait a little bit, but the customer support was great!"
"Helpful, efficient and reassuring customer service regarding a delay with my parcel. Felt at ease knowing that it is being dealt with."
Taran has been very efficient and helpful thank you
"Ordered a package on the 28th November that never arrived, contacted customer service and was advised a replacement would be sent, tried to contact again as no replacement was received and then after no response was issued a refund with no explanation or contact, when i contacted again i was advised simply to reorder the clothes on the app. Asked to speak to a manager and was simply told to leave a trust pilot review as they have no customer service department. Really unhappy with the way this been handled."
"Normally don't have an issue with ASOS but its been 2 weeks since I ordered my items which were next day delivery and haven't arrived. I tried to get in touch with them 5 days ago through; email, instagram and facebook and have had no response. As I said though I've had no other issues with them in the past so hopefully this can be resolved soon."
"Read this through and you will be “impressed” how Asos works. I placed a big order during Black Friday sales. The order was worth 1000 euro and had in total around 55 items. Due to the fact, that you can apply promotions only with orders less than 500 pounds/euros – I had to divide it into 2 parcels, therefore I received 2 confirmations and 2 tracking references for both packages. I was e-mailed regarding delivery date, and was patiently waiting for the order. On the actual delivery date (it was Friday), I received an e-mail that 1 out of 2 packages was not delivered due to the fact that address was UNDEFINED (I received many other packages from other couriers and never had an issue), where second parcel was still on delivery way and should be expected on Monday. I started contacting Asos – they said there is nothing they can do, Asos transferred this package to delivery company and have no responsibility for it, and according to tracking information from delivery company package is going to be returned back to Asos distributor centre.  Of course I got upset, its Holiday time, Black Friday sales and presents for family. I asked them what we can do about this situation, and if it’s possible for Asos to re-send this package to me again. They said that according to their policies, that are not allowed to re-send the orders, and all they can do is provide a refund. Basically, they said that I should expect money back on my account within 14 business days, meanwhile I can add all the items to the cart again and place a new identical order – this is the only solution they provided. I said okay, I understand everything might happen in this life and let’s move forward. When I started placing new order, I realized that 20 out of 25 items that were in my order are currently OUT OF STOCK, because everything was sold out during black Friday. That was a big problem, since there were many specific items that I really needed. I also took in account, that Black Friday had 25% discount on all items, where I didn’t have that privilege anymore. Logically, I asked for the Asos representative on the phone, to at least generate a new discount code for me as it was available during black Friday. After all the frustration, I still wanted to understand their part and go forward with it. All I asked is to “put me in the same shoes” as I was when placing the order which was not delivered – this is the only fair solution. Please take in mind, if Asos provides 25% discount code, I STILL CANNOT BUY ALL DESIRED ITEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY OUT OF STOCK. Eventually, my shopping experience went fully in a wrong way. Eventually, Asos representative said that there IS NOTHING AT ALL THEY CAN HELP ME WITH. ZERO HELP WAS POVIDED. They were not willing to provide any sort of compensation…. I also explained them that I am leaving the country for Holidays, and really need my orders according to delivery date, but again there is nothing they can do…. I truly did not see any human being cooperation..Getting back to the second parcel – first parcel was not delivered and send back to Asos (on Friday), where second parcel eventually successfully arrived on Monday!!!! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??? Just to clarify. Both parcels were ordered at the same address. One parcel doesn’t get to the destination point and reason was: ADDRESS UNDEFINED, where second parcel successfully arrived 2 days after?????!!!! Where is the logic???? None of the parcels should of been delivered in this case. There you can clearly understand that it was an issue with delivery company or specifically delivery person, who simply couldn’t find the address in one day, and eventually found it 2 days later…..After receiving second parcel on Monday, I called Asos immediately to clarify how is that possible. They said they are also very impressed that this happened, and it makes no sense how first parcel was not delivered but second got the point. Eventually, they could see that its totally not my fault and it creates a big issues for me as a customer. Therefore, I asked them again what we can do about first parcel that was not delivered, since I really needed those items. Their answer was not different: there is nothing we can do – please place a new order. I asked them straight forward: 1. What about 25% discount that was available during black Friday? I don’t have that option anymore.2. And what about all the items that I purchased and are in stock anymore? Answer was typical: nothing we can do – we apologize for inconvenience. In my opinion you have more than enough power to make your customer happy and satisfied. Desire is another question. Eventually, I decided to let it go. I lost too many nerves in last couple days having all this discussions with Asos, meanwhile zero help was received. I just decided to let it go…. I’m a fighter type of person, but I realized if they are not willing to help after all my tries and effort – than I cannot make them help me. I still needed my clothing items, so I went online, chose new items (since items that I ordered before were out of stock..) and proceeded with the order. Before making the payment, I decided to call Asos again to ask regarding Premium Delivery. (Reminder: I have to go abroad for holiday and have time limitations, therefore I cannot wait for another 2 weeks for standard delivery, and had to use Express delivery). My question was next: If I am physically located in the Netherlands, but I use Asos UK region for shopping, would Premium Subscription work in this case? Asos representative who was speaking with me on the phone, asked to hold for a minute while he can discuss it with his team, when he got back he assured me for 100% that I can purchase Premium Subscription in Netherlands and use any store region from Europe to make a purchase. All European countries work in chain, and it doesn’t matter from which region you order – it will be delivered within 2 working days by Premium Delivery. I said thank you and proceeded with the order. Eventually, when I received an order confirmation it said delivery should be expected by December 20, which is 2 weeks/not 2 days - after order was placed…….. I called Asos again… Every time you call them – you speak with different person of course. What you think they said? No sorry, if you are from Netherlands you can only use Premium Delivery for Netherlands Region…. HOW THE HELL is your staff so UNPROFESSIONAL AND SO UNEDUCATED? They provide fake information to customers, who suffer from it.. Instead of helping me out with my issue, they put me in even worst situation. Eventually, I decided to never come back to Asos anymore and spread the word about this situation to others. I am waiting for my new placed orders to arrive and I will forget about Asos as a bad dream. This is the worst shopping experience in my life. I lost five days contacting Asos daily through the phone and online chat, spoke with 20-25 different representatives, where none of them provided needed help, but oppositely were providing disinformation and being rude.Couple more things from my conversations with Asos team, which “killed me” : 1. If you go to Asos.nl which is Netherlands region website, under support page they do not have CHAT option available at all. It’s simply disabled for Netherlands. I had to go to UK region, where eventually my order was placed, in order to communicate through CHAT. Ten out of twenty times, Asos representatives were not even willing to cooperate with me, and their reason was: Sorry, you are from Netherlands region, and you speak with Asos UK. We are going to transfer you to NL team where they can help you out. EVENTUALLY THEY SIMPLY CLOSE THE CHAT. There is not transfer. Employees are not even aware that NL region doesn’t have CHAT OPTION. WHO ARE THEY GOING TO TRANSFER ME TOO????? That is crazy and fully unprofessional…. They simply hang up on you and say we are going to transfer you, where nothing eventually happens and you sit and wait there like an id1ot..2. Staff is very uneducated. They tell you things which they have no clue about. PREMIUM DELIVERY information was fully wrong. Information was fake and manipulated me to do the wrong moves, where I have to suffer again. One employee says one things, another employee says completely another thing.3. Besides contacting Asos through Online Chat and Phone, I sent them 2 emails, where response should be received within max 48 hours. None of my emails were answered, its been a week. P.S. I am a good person, but I truly hate you for your service and the way you deal with customers. I will do my best letting people know what kind of service you provide especially during HOLIDAYS."
Very Helpful My parcel was delivered and left outside house by Hermes. It wasn't there when I arrived home. Quickly sorted it out for me and offered a replacement or refund.
I ordered on black Friday the DKNY textured leather zip around purse(large) and they sent me the DKNY leather zip around wallet(small). At first I thought that it was just a mistake of them. But when I saw what they have done I was shocked. They changed the discriptions AND images AND prices.The purse is now called wallet and the wallet purse!! On black Friday the wallet(small) was way cheaper than purse(large). I paid for the large one and they sent me the small one and they havent even apologised for it!!! Unbelievable!! I have been customer to ASOS for years but  I'll never purchase anything from ASOS again!!!
Ella was absolutely fantastic at helping today. It was a very longwinded return and she was great. 100% an asset to asos. Very friendly and sorted my problem for me.
ASOS has a fantastic customer service team.Quality of clothes always as described and a fantastic choice for all shapes and sizes.quick delivery and easy returns.Love ASOS!!
Adil have been brilliant helping me with the problem which I have had for two weeks. Everytime I contacted ASOS I was out fobbed off and been told they are busy. So thank you Adil for solving this problem for me. 5 🌟 for you
"I spoke to Mia and straight away she offered a replacement for a missing item in the advent calendar.  Albeit she has to pass it off to another team so I actually don't yet know if this is resolved, but Mia did what she could and responded really positively"
LOVE ASOS AS ALWAYSNo other online store compares to ASOS and their customer careI will always forever shop at ASOS
Fantastic customer service!
"Waiting for my order over 15 days,inpossible to connect with customer service team, as from 10 e-mails they answer  ones, told me to wait to 9th of December. My estimate delivery date was on 28 of November. I tried online chat but I am always on a  Que, and nobody answer. I am tired of sending an e-mails. Cant get my money back and do not recieve my items, same time no answer. Worst service and online shop. I will never purchase anything from them"
Adil was very helpful. I couldn't find a way to use my NUS/TOTUM account to get 10% off like I usually do. He was quick to respond and sent me a direct link to use and was very pleasant to chat to! I use ASOS very regularly and have always experienced great customer service.
Excellent customer service and great value for money
The representative was unhelpful. appeared to mostly copy and paste responses. did not present me with a solution and just closed the chat without letting me know.
I was helped by two excellent customer service reps who handled everything fast and efficiently!
"This time Ravika was very helpful so it would be a five star, but last time I contacted customer care with an issue they did not give any solution and they primised to get back later but nothing happened."
"Update: I ordered 3 weeks ago for next day delivery which never arrived. Tried to contact them via chat, fb messenger, phone and email but couldn’t get a straight answer off anyone and they were just not interested! Finally today I received confirmation of my refund but it is £45 short, dont even know how that’s possible as they surely just refund the whole order. The process has been so long and stressful and when I think I’ve reached a resolution it’s wrong. Can’t believe how badly Asos have gone down hill and will definitely never use them again. Also the fake reviews on here are so easy to spot and it’s alarming how many similar reviews to mine are on here"
I chatted with Nimat today in live chat. It was a helpful conversation and he advised me on what to do with my parcel to locate it and I have just received it.
"I purchased a pair of Converse Chuck 70 on their website, and I selected US size 9 expecting it to be men sizing. When I received my pair, it was a women size 9 (way to small for me). No where on the page did it describe what the sizing was for women or men nor was there a sizing chart. While I am able to return the shoes, I am unable to get the discount if I reorder the correct, since I purchased these shoes on Black Friday and got 30% off, because the “correct item” was sent. I’m"
Was great advice
Magdelina  was great help and gave me a good helpful experience
Joanna was very helpful and prompt with her response
I don't always have a smooth service with ASOS but their customer service team are extremely efficient and helpful. Thank you Gwenne.
the customer service agents have great understanding of customer queries and issue. they are able to source a solution very quickly. really friendly.
Everything perfect 👌🏼
Daniel was very easy to deal with and understand customer experience principles.
Abbas was nice and he really helped me! Thanks again!
Thanks for the fast response.
Spot on about every query. Awesome.
Hanim was super quick and helpful
It is what it is. Glad live chat was helpful.
Frankie was absolutely amazing in dealing with my problems and resolved them as quickly as he could.
He was helpful and promised a replacement since I couldn’t get any track about my package
"Quick responses, answered all my questions and corrected the issue!"
"If I could give less than one star, I would. Your team has been extremely unprofessional. I reached out yesterday on Facebook, got a response asking my inquiry, and never heard back until after I tweeted your team today. They did not respond to my problem on Twitter but replied to my FB messenger from the day before. Then they didn’t answer my response to the fb messenger until I tweeted again. I tried to email but ASOS website is so slow and uncooperative. I am waiting to hear back from a new team of customer care and hope that ASOS does right by me. This was my first attempt at a purchase from ASOS and may possibly be my last."
Easy to deal with and able to solve any issues straight away!
Marta was SO lovely and helpful!
This person helped me by going an extra mile. I had reached out to Asos for a return two times already and when this person helped me they read the previous chats before talking to me which makes a big difference as I don’t have to explain again and again.
"it has always been a great experience using Asos, but this time the parcel took 9 days and it still hasnt arrive yet. the tracking tool just shown it s still in London. I have called the courier company Skynet, sent them an email but nothing could help. and i tried to reach ASOS Customer service through live chat but it seems they cant give me an answer either. i feel disappointed and abit skeptical about buying things from ASOS anymore."
She provides good and fast service. Thank you so much
Delivery failed
Jerome was absolutely amazing I  was really worried that my order problem would be some massive issue and I would have to fight my corner but its never been so easy and calming the outcome of my chat put a smile on my face so thanks Jerome I hope your managers give you very high praise! I wish every customer service experience was like yours!!hes a great hire well done asos!!
"Far from disappointed as I didn’t not receive any updates on my order due to a technical issue as advised from customer care. They couldn’t let me know where is my order and had me wait after the due date of the delivery to tell me the order never left their wear-houses!!!! This has caused me spending more money to find another dress to replace the one I should have received plus additional time for it as I have only 3 hours to replace it if I find something! Totally unprofessional, need serious work on their policies! I will NEVER attempt to buy from ASOS again!!!! You have officially ruined my awards ceremony. Thank you!"
"Abbas was amazing. they were able to tell me the issue, fix it, and also get my items resent to me. really appreciate the customer service!"
The customer service chat was great! but the delivery was terrible.
preciso e disponibile 24h
Great communication
"The person was very kind but the answers last too long. For example, just an easy question like (from where my orders were sent: from Europe or from Us) it took me more than 10 minutes to answer it. Or for example: I have to pay entrance taxes to the country if I am from Belgium and apparently the person did not know, so we had to wait another 10 minutes."
"Wonderful customer service, quick response time and detailed message. Thank you"
"Very quick response, helpful and nice"
"Abbas of the Asos live chat was a great help, quick to connect, reply and solve my issue in a kind and personal manner, very polite and welcoming, great service!"
"Absolutely disgusted with the service I have received, I have used ASOS for many years and even pay for the next day delivery VIP each year. On Black Friday I received an email about an item I had ordered being delayed, I received no updated and contacted them multiple times and have Been ignored everytime. It is almost 2 weeks later and I have not received my items. I have also recently found another order I haven’t got but have received no email detailing the delay. Disgusted with the service I received I can’t even return the items as I can’t get In touch with anybody"
Jerome was quite professional and prompt in resolving my issue.
Pretty efficient and fast response
Easy to communicate with when dealing with my refund as I was confused how it worked.
My package says it was delivered but nothing arrived to me. Harry was super helpful and placed a replacement order for me. Thank you Harry!
Very helpful chat in which all of my problems were sorted efficiently
Terrible service Next day delivery pushed into next day without notification prior to placing order even though the normal next day delivery has not surpassed Issues with delivery’s not being received No complaints procedure No one goes above and beyond
"Very helpful, my query was resolved quickly. Mabz was polite and friendly"
I prefer online chats as it makes the process easier when there is an issue.
Faulty items are been sent over and over.2 of them in my last three orders.Wrong information + images that mean wrong orders by customers . And the assistants don't understand what's going on but follow asos orders.Way to go Asos
Suzanne was awesome
Agent : Terence
Kinga was very helpful but it is unfortunate that I my parcels are lost and I complained the day before and the advisor that I spoke to literally copy and pasted a script even though my parcel was would be 3 days delayed by then. I paid for next day delivery and ordered 3 items of only 1 arrived.
Ready to sorr problems
"I was missing two products on my delivery and Hanim from Asos, helped me out on fixing the issue and getting me a replacement."
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced! My original order was returned but never delivered. I reached out to customer service to replace my order and they wouldn't give me the 30% off I received when I placed my first order. They would only give me a 15% off promo code. I placed a second order, only to realize within 30 seconds of placing it that one of the dresses I placed in my cart was no longer there. I quickly re-ordered it using the same promo code. My card was charged, but the order was cancelled because the promo code was invalid. I reached out to customer service for a second time that day and they said they couldn't see the order and I needed to wait a hour. I waited a few hours, reached out to customer service for a 3rd time in one day, and they would not help me or reissue the promo code. Needless to say, it's been a very frustrating and disappointing experience with ASOS."
Amazing website
Dealt with quickly and efficiently. Yufuf is a credit to your team.
My delivery hasn't arrived but Emma was kind enough to inform me about work arounds.
"I order a dress from ASOS website, received the wrong item the first time. Later on I got the same promotion code and shipping fee returned - only when I asked for it. So I ordered the dress again, also using the next-day delivery shipping because I need it asap. And, this time they send the wrong thing again, and it's the same dress that they sent last time! It is either the provider's fault for providing the wrong dress or ASOS just displayed the wrong pictures online. They didn't even bother to double check the order before sending out! I contacted the customer service, they said that they would check in the warehouse, told me to return the dress and not to re-order. Of course I'm not going to reorder. In fact, I will never shop with ASOS again! No compensation, no offer, no nothing, for wasting my time and energy on this one dress!"
"Very helpful, concerned about a return but expecting the money to be back into my account in the next 72 hours after a quick message on the chat."
Frankie was very helpful on the online helpline and resolved my issue quickly.
Very helpful thank you
"Folashade was brilliant and managed to resolve what would have been a very annoying issue of returning my order. Will definitely use ASOS again even I didn't receive my outfit because it was sent out very late, I will just think twice before ordering an urgent item Black Friday/Cyber Moday. Thanks for helping!"
Connected to me momentarily! Great thanks!
Great professionalsim.
Francesa was extremely helpful and patient  with the very tedious problem I had.
Good service
"Ordered a parcel to be delivered on Monday, however, at the time of delivery both Monday and Tuesday, I was not home. I received an email advising that neighbors were not home to take the parcel. This is a lie as both days there was always someone home.On the email it specifically said delivery will be attempted twice after failed first delivery TWO CONSECUTIVE days in a row. Yet I was told today on online chat that there will be no delivery today and instead it will be done tomorrow.I requested to cancel my order and issue a refund as I will not have any need for the order that is this late.Adviser told me he is not able to do so.I requested to raise a complaint. I was told they will pass the feedback. I was not given any reference to my complaint and adviser closed the chat without any warning.Poor. Service. Extremely disappointed"
You pay for premier delivery and you might as well not bother as the items take too long. The care team are lovely but their response times are too slow and they offer no remedy or recompense for their failings.
"Had some trouble placing an order at first, because of technical difficulties on the website. And I must say I was slightly annoyed Asos does not have a phone number to call to in these situations. However they do have a live chat, and the person who responded to my question really helped me out and was very kind. 5 stars for her. Thanks!"
very prompt and helpful support
First person to give actual answers. As helpful as she could be. Thank you
Good chat service
"It was great this time around, I do have to say however that the service has varied for me, last 2 times one of the assistants did not tell me that there were checkers and just told me to wait extra time after the estimated delivery, the next one told me to go to my local post office and ask for my package, which I think should have been suggested since the first time, rather I just wasted so much more time, I had to go through over two months of waiting to get my refund and looked for support a lot, I'll point out that despite everything, the assistants are always very polite and kind."
Very helpful with my query
Fast shipping and good quality
"11 DAYS SINCE ORDER & STILL NOT DISPATCHED!!!5 EMAILS TOTALLY IGORED!!DISGUSTING TREATMENT OF CUSTOMERS.I WILL KEEP REVIEWING EVERYDAY, UNTIL THEY EITHER SEND ME MY ORDER OR REFUND THE MONEY THEY STOLE."
"I love Asos, you can find everything you need there. What I love most is that they reply fast and their live chat is the best, they solve every single problem."
Jessica was fast and accurate. Also very sweet and polite.
my problem was solved . no problems with the help i had. 5stars to Yonis . but took i while for someone to talk to me.
"Terrible delivery service, robotic customer service, delayed delivery, refunds. Third time this has happened and I pay for yearly next day delivery."
"ASOS should stand for All-Stars of Service.First and foremost, I'm 32 and still don't know how to dress. In fact, the majority of my wardrobe consists of over-sized shirts from my childhood complete with copious holes and wrinkles. But my amazing girlfriend (who handles the slobbery like a champ), turned me on to ASOS.My friends are getting married. I'm a big boy. It's time to buy suits. I ordered two packages from ASOS on Black Friday. One made it to my apartment (faster than expected) while the other went missing. Upon opening the only package I actually received, I discovered that the clothes fit well. Maybe even too well. So, I was really excited about my second package but it never came. After trading multiple calls with post offices and my landlord, ASOS was there to assist me every step of the way. I reached out to them via Facebook and the response time was minimal.They proposed a solution: Initially, they agreed to reship everything I had purchased but unfortunately, the items I had bought were no longer available in my size. (I suppose my boo has good taste.)From the MIA order, ASOS is sending me one shirt and refunding me for everything else. As sad as I am to not have received my second package, I'm extremely relieved to know ASOS is good people. They saw everything through and never doubted me from the start.High marks all around, as I don't blame the delivery issues on you."
Super helpful customer service
"Came as soon as possible, great help on customer care, would recommend shopping here"
"Gone right down in my estimation over the last year. No response to queries via Email, chat never works, use an incompetent delivery service aka Hermes, deliveries always way past the estimated delivery date. Do not use"
Quick to resolve issues
"Thank you Amy for resolving any issues I had promptly, Even if the delivery services (not ASOS directly) couldn't be bothered to knock on my door which led to my clothes being stolen. Although I may have had a bad experience once out of the many times I have ordered do not let this put you off. The time are very helpful with any queries. I'll still be using ASOS. Also the clothes are great quality and pricing is reasonable, As well as stocking their own brands and a few designers too!"
Absolutely the worse company i have ever dealt with they messed up the order and they were not apologetic at all can speak too someone as its chat onlyJoke of a company waiting on my refund i wouldn't advise anyone to shop here ever dont do it
I had a chat session with Elliot and he was very helpful and attentive.
Very helpful and nice !
Is there anyone at Asos who actually deals with complaints? Or do you just chatbot us all to death?
Abbie was really helpful.. and saved me from the missing parcel disaster..
Very nice person and professional assistanceThank you very much
"I got a wrong shoe size and Stephanie came in to save the day. She was very patient and kind and trust me, I was not the best customer but she really handled the situation in a very awesome and respectful way and diffused my anger. Thank you Stephanie."
Great support and fast reply!
"The customer service experience was very helpful in sorting my issue. The delivery from Hermes however was what had caused the issue itself. My customer service representative, Emma, was extremely helpful."
Louise was very helpful although the issue was with DPD rather than ASOS themselves. Got a full refund in the end and reordered my item. Breeze
Claude at customer service was very helpful and gets 5 stars!  however overall Asos delivery services are shocking.
"Placed an order this morning, when placed the ETA said this week which I was happy with, then when I received the confirmation email the product will not be delivered until the late side of next week??Rang up to cancel this order to which they said I need to wait for tracking information before I can cancel the order, don't really understand why it is not possible to cancel the order as it obviously hasn't been processed if its not arriving for over 7 days customer service unhelpful, wrongly advised delivery dates, no offer to help put this right, wont order again"
Great on line chat service quick response and very helpfulMany thanks
"I ordered my items from ASOS on 29th November, I have paid for next day delivery. I am still waiting on them and its 11th December. I have chatted with one Customer Care person from ASOS on the 10th December and they said I could order them again on next day delivery .... so I could have them by 12th December. Second person told me that I won't now get them till December 16th. Their are presents in that package that I want to give on Saturday .. and now I have to buy new ones. I asked the second Customer Care agent if i could get a code for a discount for next purchase and he said no. I think it is shocking service that I have paid for next day delivery and now I am still waiting for my package. And it won't come till week 4."
"Really good customer service, no complaint"
"Really happy with the way they managed my issue, as previously been told I couldn’t be justified a technical fault, I appreciated his time finding me a solution and mainly understanding my personal issue to the matter. Others should take note on how to treat customers like this."
Callum was really helpful. Gutted we missed the returns deadline as its left us short over Christmas but this is not Callum fault. Never had any issues with asos
"Their customer service is so slow- takes hours to get in touch with somebody and when you finally do you are expected to get in touch with them again another day. Its like going round in circles. Usually the delivery, quality of items and pricing is good but their customer service is terrible"
My order was due in 9/12/19 (allowing a week to arrive) and is still not with the local depot. Only received tracking info this morning and customer care have been very unsympathetic in their handling of this.
Always good service from ASOS. Ravika has been particularly quick and helpful on your Chat service today.
"Asos is a horrible site. I am in a sorority and had my whole family buy our matching pajamas from this site. No one got any of their pajamas on time so we had to buy really ugly matching ones last minute and my little felt very left out and confused all because asos would not send my stinking pajamas. The chat customer service is horrible and very unhelpful, they told me my pajamas were “lost” and it was a painfuuuuul process to get my money back. Do not count on this website or buy from here. Horrible experience, worst costumer service."
"Placed an order, received the wrong item, tried to contact them for a replacement and received no answer. Absolutely horrid customer service. Will never shop at ASOS again."
Was the best customer service I've ever had. Problem sorted with no issues.
I have gotten in touch via chat with the customer service team and spoke to Paige. She was very helpful and kind (despite this very busy and hectic time of the year). Great job!
"Amazing choice of brands, clothes, shoes, gifts, everything! Very reasonable prices and excellent customer service. I recently had an issue with a delivery and ASOS sorted it in less than 10 minutes even though it was technically the fault of the courier! Always happy with my experience when shopping on ASOS."
Chat service worked out very well - finally I get the help needed to get my money back.Thanks Niamh
Wide range of brands and great customer service
Talia was really helpful
I had an item missing from my order and within minutes the issues was resolved and a replacement sent out. My advisor Melissa was very helpful and quick to action.
"I have been such a loyal customer to ASOS for years but over the last 6 months the customer service has been shocking!!! I placed an order on the 2/12 and it was due to arrive on the 12/12 - which is tomorrow! And it hasn’t even been dispatched! I contacted support and got reassured it would be here when estimated but have now been told there is no guarantee. It is an absolute joke to expect anyone to wait over 10 days for a parcel, I understand this is a busy period but the delivery schedule has got worse over the last 6 months, I used to get parcels within a few days. I think the company really need to address these issues as it’s a common complaint I see across social media!"
It would be 5/5 if the delivery didn't take almost two weeks . Customer service very good and normally delivered in 2 to 3 days . Love asos but the latest experiences are bad .
quick and clear help
Ryan was super helpful
"Nimah was brilliant, sorted my issue out within 5 mins many thanks ASOS and Nimah!"
Great customer service. Very helpful
"Really quick Service , convenient and helpful to contact"
I was sent the wrong item and I spoke with customer service and they were very polite and helpful.
Sometimes wrong article or damaged but good customer service
Lauren was amazing and very friendly
Great customer service always willing to help!
"The chat is pretty quick and very helpful. I like Asos, this is my second purchase with them However, in both cases, I expected delivery to made sooner than when I actually received them."
Amber was excellent and lovely to deal with
"Chats are very helpful, very quick to respond and staff seem lovely."
Thank you for your great customer service. I love shopping with asos.
"I order a top from Asos and it was damaged, I contacted customer care and I spoke to Alex on live chat. He was very understanding and customer service was excellent. My order arrived as stated and I was informed as and when it had been dispatched."
"Morgan was absolutely incredible, so amazing and so professional. She solved my problem very quickly with no hassle and no long waiting time! Such an angel!"
I had a great experience talking to Bhavesh. He was really helpful with my queries. He needs a promotion! Thank you Asos and thank you Bhavesh you are a star!
great service
Chloe on the live chat was amazing! Great customer service!
very helpful!
Fast n really help
Helpdesk of asos working good. I have satisfaction )
I've been with ASOS since it was 'as seen on screen' and their customer care is excellent. Even when things occasionally go wrong they are always prompt with a response and resolution. I nearly had a breakdown when a very expensive return wasn't received. I had proof of postage and was refunded swiftly. I now have a delayed delivery because of the courier but they still chased this and let me know the new expected delivery date.
"Very polite and helpful, however a lack of information about the curriers problems resulting in delays"
"I unfortunately haven't received a parcel I ordered in October, and it can't be located naywhere. The lovely Olivia with the Customer Service team helped me double check everything, before registering an order replacement. It was completely hassle free and very friendly. Even though I'm sad I didn't receive my parcel, I can't credit the customer service team enough for making the experience enjoyable anyway."
Just had online chat issue was resolved very quickly great service
The chat is very efficient!
"I spoke with Mia, she was incredibly helpful and fast to solve my issue."
fast helpful service
Extremely efficient customer service!
"Today I received support Asos Customer Support team I would like to express how incredibly helpful the adviser Alex I spoke to was. Sadly my delivery was lost and Customer Support team very quickly helped me resolve this with a refund to compensate for the lost Christmas gifts. At this busy time of year, I was impressed by how prompt this processed for me. Much appreciated and thank for being so friendly."
Great Help! Thank you Christine
Polite and professional
Worst customer service ever and you still have my money 3 weeks later !!!
"Terrible. I have been an ASOS customer for years and, for the most part, its been great. A few weeks ago I made an order and paid for premium basically just for one jumper that I loved and was so excited to receive. Not only did they send me the wrong jumper and completely screw up my order (the jumper also sold out. so I couldn't even get them to replace it), we are now a couple of weeks down the line and I still haven't heard a word from them. Absolutely nothing. They seem perfectly happy to just pass my case between departments, keep sending me pointless emails asking for the same information over and over again. I am absolutely appalled at the way this has been handled. I would not recommend ASOS to anyone. They don't care about their customers, and couldn't care less if your. order is wrong and they've messed up."
Good response from Ryan on chat...but disappointed with Asos indicating the price of the item on the box!!!!!!!!!!!!It is telling someone at Australia Post... small box....130 dollar item... worth stealing!!!!!!Not happy!!!!!!And the turn around time of 72 hours to  responding on whether there is a replacement available is not good enough in this situation!
My order was shipped and didn’t arrive. Refund was given but I was not told the order was not going to be delivered. Asos did not honour order.
"so helpful, really understanding. Fab customer service, quick and easy to use and fast responses!"
"Friendly and concise, got my answer, no complaints here.Delivery is usually great, and the options from Asos are so useful (next day for a year for £10 is still the best deal ive seen) but depends which carrier you end up with on the day."
"Take weeks to dispatch order, customer service is non existent, email returns with “recipient’s box is full”.  You’d expect better from such a big brand"
"I placed an order on the 4th of Dec and paid extra for an express delivery to be delivered on the 9th. On the 10th i still had not received my order so decided to check via chat if there was any issues. Got through to Christine who advised my that my package had been 'lost'... Christine was quite helpful and even sent me a follow-up email with my options. I replied and requested that they send me a replacement order and asked if it could be sent with next day delivery (reasonable enough i thought) didn't hear anything back at all for a day. Went on chat again and was told next day delivery was not possible and they advise getting a refund - details of which would be sent within 72 hours via an email. This was very disappointing, i have ordered from ASOS numerous times with no issues, i just cant understand how an order could have just been lost like that after you sending me communication saying it was 'on its way, 'dispatched' and even a delivery date. I was even willing to give it another try by asking you to resend my order, but you didn't seem interested. I dont know how a customer can give you €150 and receive this poor of a service!"
"Prompt replies & good service. Very pleased with the effective service I received. As promised, they sent me informative updates and did not keep me out of the loop on the situation, while they worked to get the issue resolved quickly."
My order was not delivered by Hermes and they said they had. This leaves me in a difficult and stressful position before Christmas and I was really upset. Amy in customer care listened to me and agreed to resend my order to my work address ( parcels signed for by security) to ensure I get my parcel. Thank you Amy!
Very helpful

"Horrible customer service, misleading people, different delivery information, but they are not providing proper info where is your package. I ordered my package on 28th of November, as I wanted to make sure it will arrive on time. However I never received email that it left the warehouse, they are not able to provide you information about the package, you have to contact with them also to get your tracking number, which clearly shows that it is this in the warehouse. If you ask them about your package before the delivery day which was on 10th of December in my case, they say wait until the 10th or wait until 17th. Once the delivery day passed and clearly your order is nowhere, they inform you to wait until 31st of December... This is unacceptable, once you request them to refund your package, they said wait until you receive it... Thank you ASOS! Well played."
"I have been waiting nearly 3 weeks for my order to be dispatched and the expected delivery time keeps changing. Have seen so many people complaining about this so it isn't just me. I understand its Christmas period and its busy but you shouldn't take orders if you cannot send them in time. I needed this outfit for a works do, which I have now ordered an additional outfit elsewhere because I know it wont come in time."
Very good!!!
"I am very happy with my recent asos custmer care service. I talked to Mihaela, she was very helpful."
I have a problem with my order and I Just spoke to Jenna and she made feel at ease straight awayThank you ASOS as always
"I am disappointed that I placed a order for two short sets and I only received the shorts. I spoke to a ASOS representative and they expressed that they were supposed to come as separate pieces. It was poorly advertised that; that was the case. It should not be advertised as a two piece set and if so, it should have had “items sold separately” parentheses so that it is clear to the buyer. I feel like I was tricked into buying two $40 pair of shorts that I would have never brought if that was the case. I am set to leave out of the country next week and I now I have to spend more money to replace what I thought I would have received from you guys. Overall this was a very disappointing experience and I don’t think I will be doing business with you guys again until I see improvement. And it’s sad because I actually spoke very highly of this company and shared your info with many that had no clue about who and what you were."
"It has been a full week of stress and anxiety attempting to get ASOS to fulfil their Consumer Rights commitment. I actually think my hair is falling out at this point. I have been a loyal customer of ASOS for 5 years now, both in New Zealand and in the UK. I have never had any issues until this week long saga has made me question whether ASOS really values their customers above their delivery partner, or at all, at all. I’ve spent the last week out of pocket from a missing parcel (which I replaced in good faith that your customer care team would see is an obvious case of driver fraud and refund my money) and on the phone to customer care at both ASOS and DPD.DPD have treated me like absolute trash, running a half hearted investigation into the false “safe place” request that did not come from myself, refusing to open another (after ASOS initially did not provide them with screenshots I sent on December 4th - day of delivery) cutting off my calls and denying their culpability. Last night Deniz from the ASOS customer care team agreed my case was worthy of reopening an investigation, attempted to ring DPD and was hung up on 3 times. Your colleague then suggested I go straight to my card holder as this was worthy of a refund.My card holder has now also agreed I absolutely have a case due to all the screenshots but has said the refund will need to come from ASOS and will take up to 3 weeks to process. So I am trying one last time to implore you to take away the middle man and honour my rights in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.Your customer care team have agreed I am in the right My card holder has told me I am in the right I KNOW I am in the right. I IMPLORE you to honour your contract with ME as the consumer and not just treat this like a stock standard case of DPD getting away with crappy service.If not, i will continue my case with my card holder in which I have been assured I will get my money back in due time however I ask that instead you honour my rights, value my 5 years of loyalty, believe me and refund this order or you have sadly lost a customer forever. Thank you Lauren Shamy"
"ASOS customer service team via twitter have been so professional, really quick responses and dealt with my issues really efficiently and effectively couldn’t be happier would definitely not hesitate to contact them in the future for assistance"
Great customer service!
Very happy with my purchase except of wrong sizing.  Unfortunately they do not do exchanges with Australia. Customer service operator for online chat was very helpful.
Johnny was amazing. Simple as that.
"My item got lost while shipping to myself and I never received the item after being charged and received confirmation it would come before my holiday party. I spoke with Deanna via Live Chat and she found my order, explained what happened, and processed my refund right away. I was also experiencing issues with my email and she provided the tools to get everything working smoothly. Great customer service! Thank you again!"
Feedback was well handled by deanna
"Returned and received a refund for a pair of shoes but they were shipped back to me incorrectly. Talked with my customer service representative, Paul, who was an immense help with the issue. Quickly figured out the issue and told me the necessary steps in order to resend the shoes back. One of the easiest and friendliest customer service experiences."
"ASOS were amazing at noticing my account was hacked, shutting it down and getting in touch to sort it out. It saved me so much hassle and I was really impressed with the customer service team."
"I love using ASOS, it’s a lovely experience, even when order issues happen- they are timely and available to help."
I love all the ways you can view the items!! Fast response on chat customer service as well.
"The representative was (Devenia), was able to help with my concerns. She was very helpful in tracking my package and initiating a request to process a replacement for my missing items."
Jordan in customer services is excellent. Really helpful.
"I ordered over a week ago. The item finally came and I only received 1/3 items that i ordered. I contacted ASOS and the rep offered to resend the items but it would take over a week. I was upset since they didn’t try to offer a better solution like expedited shipping. Once i mentioned it, then it was offered. I was told someone would contact me within 48 hours to get the shipment sent and no one has contacted me. Now at this point i want a refund."
"ok honest for solution , but, my stuff never come"
AQUIB was really helpful
Lisa was helpful and thorough.
"ASOS has delivery problems between late and missing deliveries, but the customer service people I got were very helpful. Paul in particular was helpful and efficient and cleared things up for me."
"I've ordered from Asos many times, and I've never had any issues until today. I've had such great experiences that I decided to pay the annual fee for free 2-day shipping. On Monday 12/8/19, I ordered a dress for a holiday party, and for whatever reason FedEx said it was delivered but the package never made it to my house. I had to go through customer service to get a refund. They made the refund process very easy. I only wish I was able to get the dress replaced via rush delivery instead of getting my money back. The customer service agent said they couldn't guarantee the 2 day rush delivery in this instance. :("
I had an issue with my order in which I didn't receive an item.  I contacted customer service and it was hassle free to get a refund.  Customer service was AWESOME.  Thanks Charlie!
Laura was very helpful and help me get another order on the way
This chat was good and David really helped me
"Awful company which I recommend you boycot for their faulty items and rude customer service advisors. Been a customer for many years but customer service is so bad when there is a problem they do not care nor fix it. I ordered an item which arrvied faulty. Asos would not do anything about it just told me to send it back for an exchange. So I did. I then got refunded the item, when it was still in stock the whole time. I didn't want a refund I wanted the item ordered specifically for an event. They refused to re send it. Told me to re order. I did not wish to do this paying for delivery again. In the end I never got the bag. Asos do not care about customers and did not compensate me and offered a poor 10% off future orders which is a joke, especially so as I get that for student discount anyway, so they offered me nothing. They do not quality check items nor resolve complaints. You are better off going to primark. A few weeks prior I ordered some earrings which arrvied broken. They were refunded without issue but there was no apology and the bag was never replaced. 2 faulty items in a row. Disgraceful. Highly disappointed from assos."
Roheel was very quick handling my issue! Much appreciated! As always ASOS amazing with customer service.
"Amazing customer service, one of the few live chats where everything's dealt with so promptly, can't fault them"
Do not deal with “Aramex” delivery it is the worst .. never get order in time evvveeerr
"Great expirence, it was very helpful!"
Quick and detailed responses.
Had an issue with a missing item - was put through to a member of the chat team (Elysha) who sorted it out within 5 minutes :) A+
"quick delivery, the customer service advisor Samrat was able to resolve my problem, they were clear and very prompt when typing back."
"No delivery of item 11 days after the supposed delivery date, which left me with no graduation dress. But worse, they have not responded to any emails asking for help with locating the parcel. They've just taken my money and provided no goods or assistance. DO NOT use Asos if you want an outfit for an occasion within the next month. I've used Asos for years, unfortunately it looks like they've totally gone down the pan and I'll take my business elsewhere."
Excellent service
Very straight forward and helpful
Amazing customer service! Thank you!
"My item changed description, photos and colour after I had ordered and when I saw it I asked if they could change it ( the order still hadn't left ASOS) but to no avail. Now I will have to go through the hassle of returning it and buying the right one."
I was given the information I had requested regarding my returns.. although it took a little time for the advisor to respond but it was fine after a little wait..
"Quality products, many brands to choose from, good layout and easy to filter and order. A little unsatisfied with the slow delivery and delivery updates (tracking info is incomplete, I really cannot track my order after leaving your warehouse, orders already delivered to me apper undelivered in “my orders”). Ordered something a week ago, still not sent from the warehouse."
"I always used to shop at ASOS - Infact, I have probable spent thousands of pounds with them in the past. Not just because I thought they had well priced clothes, but also because the customer service used to be fantastic. Any issue used to be dealt with with the customers best interest at heart, they were loyal to their customers, and in return customers were generally loyal back.Lately, I have had a few issues, and all of them have been dealt with appallingly.1. I ordered a jumper which took around 3 weeks to come. This was only after I made endless phone calls to DPD, ASOS customer service, along with messages on their Facebook messenger. They told me that they needed to wait 5 working days for DPD to respond. Another wasted week. Eventually the jumper came, but I wonder if it would have ever showed up had I not spent realistically over an hour of my life making calls and sending messages.2. The same jumper was too big, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement. Again, I heard nothing for about 2 weeks, so yet again I got in touch with ASOS customer services. Arbz basically told me that the issue was no longer their responsibility and they were not sending out another jumper, as they haven’t received mine.Unfortunately, I stupidly mis placed my proof of postage, so am unable to prove that I actually sent it back. My word is simply not good enough after many years of being a loyal customer and several thousands of pounds later.3. Why are ASOS no longer rewarding their loyal customers? I understand that they are in a bad place financially (high turnovers, low profits/non-existent profits), and will likely need a bail out in the foreseeable future. However, cutting money by offering poor customer service = bad retention, and ultimately means less turnover. Come on ASOS! How about you remember how to properly look after your customers and begin to focus on what really matters to your business again!"
They helped me with my refund and it was a great experience.
"Ordered with standard delivery, now the item is missing pass the expected delivery date (2 weeks late) and they can't provide any help with tracking the order. Instead they told me to contact my postal office and see if they have it. So who's gonna contact me when it arrives? What the actual f I'm sorry. That's 200 dollars paid for so much trouble."
Robyn was really helpful and great!
Really helpful advisor Amy resolved my problem quickly and professionally
"Return process is poor.  I pay for premium shipping and yet 3 out of 5 items were not in the shipment.  I need to go through Facebook messenger to communicate and it takes a long time to hear back.  I am still not sure if the missing items have shipped.  If yes, they should ship immediately, but I have no way of knowing."
Excellent customer service. Shipments are in very good condition
"Elisha service was quick and great. As i am a regular member of asos, not so happy with the way this order has gone."
Unlike fedex and the post office the service at asos was excellent. i got to live chat instantly without hassle and the person named daniel who helped me was very helpful.
"ASOS always send wrong quantity of order, but customer services are very good."
I had a problem as a older person I thought I would receive a gift voucher I ordered on the internet but when my son came round he said the confirmation with the number on was all I needed. I wished he would have told me earlier before I contacted ASOS as I felt a really brain dead old boy but the young lady I dealt with at ASOS was so helpful and explained that is the way ASOS work as being everything is all internet service based. Thank you for help and making me feel not inadequate sorry I didn’t get your name.
"This order has brought me no end of hassle. It was supposed to be a next day delivery, after placing my order I was told it would arrive on Sunday (not saturday). I appriciate that I may have missed the cut off deadline, and was happy to recieve a dispatch notice on saturday night, say it would be delivered on sunday. Sunday however, my parcel did not arrive, so on Monday I got in touch via live chat to a member of staff called Paige. I explained that my works do was that day (monday), that my parcel was missing with my outfits in, and that I had no idea when I was to expect them. I was told I would have to wait until the 12th. Which was 5 days over due. I explained I wanted to complain, and escalate this issue, but was told there was no way to do so, and that the live chat would be used to take feedback on board. I asked to be notified with a follow up regarding my complaint, and was told that wasn't possible. I was told there was no contact details for complaints, no form and no way to highlight my issues other than in my live chat with Paige.Today,  I arrived home to a note from hermes saying that they had tried to deliver my parcel, it was the last attempt and that I would have to get back in touch with the seller. Which I did this evening. I was on live chat with Lisa (refrence for chat: 24411465) for nearly an hour. The collegue I spoke to repeatedly ignored what I was trying to explain in my messages, and just continued to repeat that hermes will try and deliver tomorrow, and if they don't I am to get in touch.I asked several times if I could just cancel the order, as that is what had happened last time my bridesmaid dresses had gone missing in September. I was told no. I asked for a complaints contact link, as this issue has cause me so much stress. This time I was sent the relevant link to highlight my concerns. I've been told that I now have to wait to see if hermes will deliver tomorrow, if not I'm to get in touch again. I would implore you to encourage your staff to know company policies eg links to a feedback form, contact details and a customers right to highlight concerns and issues. I have now had several isses with asos, and each time I try and believe its an anomaly. On other occasions ASOS staff have been so helpful, however this time, I just felt like I was pushed from pillar to post, and lied to repeatedly. My parcel still isn't here, and it's now down to me to try and chase it up and resolve it, as I've had little to no customer support."
"Lisa was very understanding and considerate of the issue at hand.  She also was extremely helpful in sorting out my refund while apologising for the duration of time it had taken.  Overall, I am most impressed with her customer service and promptness in helping me.  It would have been confusing for her as I had already spoken to another staff member (twice) on chat previously about this (which I gave her the ref # for) but she quickly understood what was going on and resolved it for me.  I am really happy with the chat customer service option, makes it so much easier than calling or emailing and waiting for a response.  Keep up the great work Lisa and thank you again for sorting it out."
Martin was great to work with when replacing my missing items!
Conversation wih Hamad was fully helpful
Great live chat from Paul very fast and efficient and kept me updated all the way
"Packaged arrived in fairly reasonable time. Items are in good condition, but me of my palettes were missing. ASOS was very helpful and friendly. They managed sort out my problem quickly."
Very helpful and answered all the problems I needed assistance with
Had a missing item from my order and the customer service team were extremely responsive in helping get it all remedied
mahad was very help ful i give him five stars also erim helped before thank you both
Sara was awful in dealing with my concerns. She ended the chat because she couldn’t give me a straight up solution. ASOS sent me the wrong shoes and she was advising me to pay more as if it was my fault.
Clear and helpful live chat customer service experience - thanks Azeem
"Helpful friendly staff, Shannan resolved my problem of missing item very quickly"
"My chat advisor was fantastic, resolved my problem quickly and efficiently"
Good price with easy and straight to the point customer service. Only downside is that they use Hermes for delivery. Hermes left my parcel outside in the rain and forged a signature for it. Glad that the customer service is good but wouldn't have had to contact them if Hermes weren't so bad!
How can a company of such a large scale have such huge problems through the busy festive period... disgusting. Such long waiting time for an order to be dispatched. Spoken with customer service twice and they have said my order is going to be delivered by the end of the day tomorrow.... it's 8pm at night and my ordered still hasn't been dispatched. I needed these products for an event and the company can't even give me a solid answer as to when i can get my goods! Very poor customer service.
"SUPER SLOW delivery service. My order took up to a month to receive and the tracking status wasn't even updated. When my order arrived, the jeans run small and to return the item, it costs you $22.4 for the shipping cost..."
"Quick, helpful, friendly. Was able to handle everything in the moment, and the ability to attach photos so I can show what the issue was, was a great feature as well! Thanks!"
my order was missing an item but it was easy to get in touch with customer service to get it sent to me
"Been emailing customer service for a week now and still no reply. My order is no where to be found, ordered these clothes for a holiday to new york and now been left with nothing, fuming. Maybe if customer service had replied to me this wouldn't have been the case. Never shopping here again."
I like the help
After 1hour complaint with Jade  as I had a missunderstanding with another representative Jade didn't want to refund the delivery costs because of a mistake from their end.I have reopened a chat with hasan straight after and sorted my issue within 5 minutes. TOP SERVICE.
I wouldnt recomend buying two of the same things from asos. I bought 2 shoes and one came brand new and still packed and the second was used and wore and the customer service is really poor and now no one can help get a express exchange for a event. Surely wont be buying anything from here again.
The worst experience and most confusing. I ordered an outfit for the first time with ASOS for the Black Friday event! Received the pants and not the top. Now the top is sold out in a size 2 so now I will purchase the size 0 that may or may not fit. The company asks me to place a separate order with shipping fees and without my original discount that was applied on Black Friday. They will “reimburse me later” which is hard to believe because it took forever to speak to one agent !!!! Not to mention they sent me to about 5 different agents within 10 minutes to start where the other one left off. How utterly confusing and weird. I will never be shopping with them again. I will make sure all my followers on Instagram don’t as well.
Good customer service and great prices!!!
Good prices and products.  It's just a shame their chosen delivery service lets them down.
Very nice lady!
Brilliant customer service to resolver an issue where some of my items had been stolen our my package by the courier company.
"Ordered a few bits from them 10 days ago, still not received them and have emailed asking where they are and they are not replying. I understand they may be slightly busier than usual, but considering they have £100 from me, I expect to at the very least be kept updated as to why it is taking so long. Most likely won’t buy anything from them again."
I unfortunately did not received my delivery and was really upset about it. But the costumer service made sure to assist me and offer me the best way to handle the situation. I'm very pleased with the service. Thank you.
Used live chat to organise a refund - very quick and efficient service conducted by a highly competent and friendly member of staff. Very impressive service.
"good service, not satisfying answer based on previous conversation"
a bit slow but i can tell he was trying to help
Excelent!!!!!!!!
"Very quick and efficient. My delivery was delivered to the wrong address and I was offered a replacement or refund of which I chose replacement, this was put in next day delivery. All of this was resolved in under 15 minutes, excellent customer service."
"Got immediate help on a lost item that the post office seemed to have lost, they replaced the item and it was a great and fast help since I need the dress for a function. Thank you!!!"
Super efficient support!
there is a variety of products to choose from and customer service is especially prompt in replying to you if you have any queries.
The response to my recent query with international non delivery was very satisfactory.
Alex from Costumer Care was super helpful and quick in assisting!Thank you Alex
Shannan was great and timely in her response.
Lauren was so quick in resolving my query - was worried I'd be waiting for ages to even speak to a rep given the time of year but I got through quickly and she gave me the answer I needed and more which is fab :)
"Thanks, Chelsea"
"Renato was lovely and very helpful, thank you"
Good experience with Leah!
Yonis was incredibly helpful five stars! But ASOS procedures regarding returns and admitting fault 1 star!
"Very helpful, fast and friendly"
Anne was great! Patient and helpful.
"Ordered items, nearly 2 weeks later still showing delivery dates, but customer service says order never complete??? they sent a confirmation email and still showing as delivery due. So i am told to reorder and the items i ordered are now 2-3 times the price or out of stock.Terrible customer service.I now need to reorder xmas present somewhere else."
"Elliot was very helpful and polite, made me feel at ease"
quick and useful feedback
I spoke to Sarah at 14:20 approximately today on the 10th December 2019 and she was extremely helpful and calm and her help allowed me to get my issue resolved immediately and she helped me realise that it wasn't an issue at all- great service - thanks Sarah
"Great attitide , very fast"
Owen was very helpful in assisting me with an order that did not arrive. He was prompt in getting back to me and arranged the refund right away.
"I ordered a dress in early November for my holiday parties in mid to late December however somehow my shipment got lost, I was never provided with a tracking number and i now come to find out I can expect the dress no later than Dec. 31st... I am extremely disappointed with both the lack of organization and the lack of communication at Asos. I sent an email and a direct message through Facebook to Asos inquiring about my parcel and they never got back to me. I have loved this company and was more than aware that the delivery can often take up for 3 weeks but I never expected that a single dress could take 6 weeks to arrive. Ridiculous."
Love the fact that customer service is extremly fast and available in real time through the chat option. Great work!
"Quick, helpful and desired outcome received"
"Very fast delivery, although the prices could be lower"
"My parcel was opened on delivery without any reason. Asos have no clue why carriers are opening customers parcels, just to be noisy I guess. Carriers need to step up with their job and deliver parcels without opening them."
"Laurayn was efficient and comforting, thank you!"
"I was assisted by a very helpful agent, Alex. Very quick replies and quick resolution. Extremeley helpful."
Extremely helpful and got my issue resolved efficiently and with great customer service.
"Talia was straight on my case and sorted it out for me immediately. Great speedy service, very satisfied"
customer service was overall amazing
"The customer service was really quick and efficient, they sorted my issue out really quickly"
I regularly order with ASOS and recently received an order containing the completely wrong size(even though I clearly ordered correctly) this order was a gift for my mum (which was even delivered late) so you can imagine the inconvenience this caused. ASOS does nothing to help customers other than advise to return and PAY for express delivery for another jumper. Why should I pay for express delivery when they made the mess up on this size? Then the same person who advised this also closed the chat without resolving my compliant. Very rude.Not satisifed.
Connor was excellent and helped to resolve my order issues - missing items
Thomas was very helpful. Give him a raise
Had an issue with my delivery (thanks to Hermes) and Asos was very fast and helpful in sorting it out. Always have very nice products and at good prices and always very prompt with delivery
Very helpful indeed. Thank you.
I’m a customer for 6 years now and i have never been disappointed they always make me happy.
Thameena was great help when talking on live chat
"Every time i have been in contact with ASOS customer service they have always been a great help! I particular, Tye who helped me today was a great!"
Delivery with Hermes is always an issue. The local courier in the area causes problems. I have had at least 2 issues with Hermes deliveries going missing over the last year. Any other courier is able to deliver fine. ASOS support have been able to resolve my issue quickly with either refund or replacement when possible and have nothing but positive experiences dealing with them. The issue lies with Hermes. Please consider using alternatives.
The most helpul and friendly costumer service
Elliot helped solve my issue with the missing item in my package. I love asos
"My parcel went missing, however the online chat agent May was really helpful and sorted my issue with ease."
Kris was a fantastic help with my problem and sorted it in under 8 minutes
Very friendly and reassuring. Thanks.
"Anne-Marie had excellent customer service, she stayed calm and attentive to my questions and helped me swiftly.Great service."
Excellent shop. Just love it. But sometimes free delivery is unexpectedly bad.
Do not order from here they will lose your order and not even let you know!
great service from Jordan
"Bhavesh was really clear and helpful with helping resolve my issue after receiving faulty trainers. I was previously losing connection with the live chat which was really frustrating, hence why I have 4 stars instead of 5. However, Bhavesh was very apologetic and helpful."
"Aurelia was lovely, very pleasant to speak to and very helpful! Very happy with the service :D"
"Worst customer service ever. I was meant to receive my order on the 31st Nov. 10 days later and it still hasn't arrived, I received no notifications or updates about it. No one is replying to my emails or messages on Facebook / Instagram. I just need to understand what is happening, whether I will still receive my items or expect a refund. No one has replied to me in a week. A waste of time and money"
Great support - thank you!
Very helpful and polite.
The duration and processing of return orders are too long.
"Busier the silly season, yet its a great excuse to use the live chat network for an enquiry. Nice time with Sara but no new way to get thru faster for me. I could guess!!"
Had some trouble with my delivery and chatted with Adil from ASOS support. All my questions got answered in a timely manner and I was 100% satisfied with the help I received. Need more support operators like Adil!!
"Always a good experience. Even when the delivery partner has been difficult to work with, they have always resolved the problem. Always will return!"
Channa was a wonderful help. Thank you
Quick and really helpful.
"I've used Asos for a while now after finding my favourite ever pair of trousers from there. I use the wonderful Klarna payment function so I can try my orders out before paying for them and waiting for a refund back to my card if I need to send it back.My last refund, unfortunately, got stuck in the system and was not credited back to my account in the normal time. Being quite a large order, I was concerned that I would be charged for the order and being close to Christmas, that would have been a nightmare! I spoke to the lovely Tayyibah on Asos live chat this morning and within minutes, my refund had issue had been resolved and my Klarna account had been settled. Excellent, friendly and efficiant service and gave me the peace of mind that if i have an issue that it can be sorted with no issues. Thank you Asos!"
Emma from the Chat team was absolutely fabulous. Great customer care in the busy festive periods. 5 stars from me
"I ordered a jumper and paid for it , it was never delivered but I received an e mail telling me thank you for my return !!! I had never received anything let alone  returned anything . It was a present and it let myself and my son down ...they took 4 days to get back to me after I sent 7 emails . They told me I would have a refund in 10 days but here we are day 9 and still no refund . They suggested re ordering the product if I still wanted it but I found  the risk of losing more money that I paid upfront unacceptable so I went to Zara and bought a beautiful jumper there .....still no refund from Assos"
Ben was very helpful in resolving my issue
Excellent customer service and timely responses.
"Unfortunately it is too long to wait for English support but Cortes managed to help and was patient because I was struggling with Spanish. The issue was with applying the discount code, it was showing as expired and I had to try several times. Eventually it worked. Now I hope the clothes will fit and it wasn't in vain."

"Asos is a very reliable and very pleasant site. Matching always present and fast for each questioning.I recommend a thousand times, and in addition delivery all over the world"
Alex was very helpful
Leigh Ann was very helpful
Jadine was very helpful in figuring out what was going on with my return. She gave me a specific time frame and explained in details how the process worked.
"Awful experience. Paid for Premier Delivery and but it wasn't available when I placed my order, even though it had been activated. Chat help was absolutely helpless. Couldn't care less about the service I had paid for and what they had promised to deliver for it."
"Took a little bit of time to get through to the online chat but once through, Chloe was very helpful. It is slightly frustrating that you cannot speak to someone personally over the phone but overall a positive experience."
Miheala was very helpful via the ASOS chat function and was able to confirm that my query had been resolved. Many thanks.
"I have always had good experiences with asos up until now. I appreciate this is a busy time of year but that is no excuse for the lack of communication and the extremely long delay in sorting my issues. I could not get in touch with anyone for a week and was offered no explanation as to what was going on or why I had not been contacted. Although my issue has apparently been resolved, it has taken 10 days to reach a resolution."
"I’ve placed over 100 orders with ASOS over the years and never had problems up until the last 6 months. Now I have an issue with every order. They are all different issues such as, orders not  being dispatched, orders going missing in transit, refunds not being given, or the wrong values being refunded. I was previously a customer who placed an order every week, but I will no longer use the website as I don’t have the endless free time to spend speaking to their customer service team."
Really helpful
"Black Friday offer: A SCAM FOR CASHFLOW. Order never received.My work colleagues ordered me a birthday gift in a black Friday offer, however I never received it. First, despite me paying for a next day delivery subscription - the parcel was scheduled to be dispatched 2 weeks after the order was placed. This makes me think Asos is selling goods they dont have in stock.My parcel was then marked as ""dispatched"" - but there was never any attempt to deliver it and it was ""sent back and refunded"".Half of the products on order are now out of stock, the other half are obviously full price.I had numerous chats with customer service, who were ""at a loss"" with what happened, and despite my pleas not to cancel my order and redeliver, nobody got in touch with me since.Nice little scam for Asos- who are obviously struggling with cash flow, to bump up their sales for Black Frdiay with investors."
"The chat service, although the wait was quite long, was useful and helped me get the answers I needed with my faulty order. Although this service was useful I would avoid contacting by email or Facebook messenger chat as I did not here back from either yet and I had been waiting nearly a week!"
"I contacted customer service and chatted with Jaime.  Jaime was very polite, kind, helpful. I had a good experience"
Very fast and efficient work of Nisha!
"So far , so good, order dispatched very promptly and efficiently. The problem is HERMES, who say they have delivered but haven't.The follow up with BHAVESH on live chat was excellent and he has done all he can to resolve the problem. A replacement I hope."
Lots of choice and good customer service
Charlie was satisfying and helpful
"Very quick and helpful - sorted within a matter of 5 minutes, thank you Adam for your help!!"
Great and speedy customer service 😊
Chat function is easy. Quick delivery and easy returns
"I was missing two items from my parcel and after an initial first message via facebook which was not responded to, I was connected to Dani via the interactive chat who was incredibly helpful and informative. They looked into my case and have now attempted to sort the issue. I have a few days now to wait until I receive a further response regarding the issue, but after my experience chatting with Dani I am now hoping for a more positive outcome than initially expected."
Substandard merchandise. Will not use Asos again. Quality is shocking. I expect items to be stitched properly!
"He asked for my questions in fast, and explain everything I want, big thanks"
Sarah was so helpful with my questions and concerns! 10/10
quick response and immediate resolution
Christine was very friendly and helpful thank you
Stuart was VERY helpful in a fast and timely manner.
I had an issue with a return so I contacted customer service through their live chat. Mihaela was quick to request the proper information and was helpful in getting the return process manually started.
"This was my second contact with asos about the same order. The first conversation was incredibly unhelpful, I got no genuine information and some long boiler plate answers I could've read in faqs. The second conversation with a different agent (ref 24296127) was actually helpful, he gave honest answers and resolved the issue with the courier quickly."
"Both times I have been on an ASOS live chat they have helped me in under 10 minutes, very polite and always make sure they are doing the best they can to make my experience better."
Joseph was very cortuous and answered all my queries efficiently. He was extremely helpful. Thank you Joseph.Merry Christmas to all ASOS team.
Lovely and very prompt responses!
"I just didn’t get my order and I sent an email to that regards, I didn’t get a response for three days until I resorted to chatting. The agent was able to respond and hopefully I’ll get the replacement in due time."
kris was great!
My issue was resolved ! Thanks Joanna .
very helpful
Liam was very helpful and patient in getting my order issue resolved. He helped me understand how to return items that I did not even order in a package that didn't have a packaging slip. He is also in the process of sending me the items I did not receive in my order.
Kate was very helpful and made me feel comfortable asking about my refund status. I love how easy it is to contact ASOS Customer Care and how easy returns are if you're buying more than one size of an item. 10/10 recommend ASOS!
NARINA WAS AN AMAZING HELP TODAY WITH MY ISSUE AND SOLVED INSTANTLY
Liam was amazing. He was very patient with me and did an excellent job. At first I was angry because it took ASOS 3-4 weeks to process my full refund but Liam did great. Thank you Liam.
"There was a problem with delivery, went through email and didn’t hear back because of the holidays, so went to twitter and got back to me instantly. Fixed the problem! Misty was very quick and nice."
"The products are great (quality matches or exceeds for the price point from basics at low prices higher end products), the customer service is excellent, and the range of products is great- I have always found something (or multiple choices) for the occasions or needs that I have. The only negative is that sometimes things sell out so quickly and I end up missing out on some really cute items. The shipping is so quick too which is great for short notice occasions."
"Lisa is a great customer service agent, but the delivery service that used by ASOS is untraceable"
Excellent customer service received with noProblem.
"Nigel was awesome helping me out with my returns. He was patient, honest and understanding."
great customer service!
good service.
Easy to work with and good response and timing
"ASOS is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. I ordered two pairs of shoes on Black Friday because of an amazing deal. I received my package fast but they sent the wrong size shoes! I immediately contacted them and they didn't seem to care at all. They just said send them back. I planned on it but I asked if they do an exchange and they said no, that you have to repurchase the items if you want them before they issue you a refund. I said fine whatever...since your company made the mistake can I have a coupon code to get the shoes at the same price I originally paid? The said a ""special department"" does the coupons and that they would review it and send me one but it would take 24-48 hours....how fricken ridiculous that the customer service agent couldn't just give me one since they screwed up. I ANXIOUSLY waited for them to contact me to give me the coupon code because both pairs of shoes are limited stock in the size I was supposed to receive originally. I was emailed by them today that they will not be giving me a coupon code until the shoes are returned to them which can take up to 10 days according to them. 10 DAYS!!!!! I'm scared to death that the shoes will be sold out by then and all because ASOS doesn't care about their customers at all. These were meant to be Christmas presents and because of how they're being I doubt I will even be able to get the shoes at all. I am absolutely appalled that they treat their customers like this, I only tried them because I've seen YT influencers shop with them often and recommend them. I am WARNING everyone  I know to run, do not order from them, they screw up and don't care. They just want your money and expect you to spend more money to fix their mistakes. I was originally upset they just wouldn't do an exchange but fine whatever I got over it and just said give me a coupon code so I can hurry up and order the shoes before they're sold out, but they essentially said F U. Please please please do not shop with this company. BEWARE!!!!!"
Rebecca was the best and they figured out a time-sensitive sizing mishap immediately!
"The customer service was good, I felt like the person was really trying to help me. However it wouldn't have been needed if ASOS had got my order right! I ordered three dresses and received none of them, I got a different person's order. Now all the dresses are sold out and I am extremely disappointed."
Lily was very patient and helpful!
"You've got rid of web chat, and I had to use facebook messanger, thecustomer consultant didnt listen to my question and asked for a lot of detail which was irrelevant, had 3 touch points to get the right answer."
"I have spoken to three chat representatives, of which none could give me an answer as to why my order has not shipped yet. I paid for overnight shipping last week and never received the order. I don't understand what happened with my order. This is the worst customer service ever. Why is there a customer service chat if they can't answer any questions?"
"Always love my ASOS. Seamless shopping experience from product range to size assistance, smooth customer service, and timely delivery time frames."
Frustrated with the false estimated delivery date but how can you be mad at Misty? She was very kind .
There’s always trouble with next day delivery. They use the cheapest courier services which always manage to deliver the packages to the wrong addresses.
Great service from Johnny
"Stevie and Dena from customer care were very knowledge, helpful & effective. I had a issue and it was handled appropriately.  I appreciate the good service ."
the misty is good helped in what I asked
"I got Jonathan and he was very helpful, he answered all my doubts, great person"
"I was abruptly informed that I initiated a refund which i did not. Turns out the order was cancelled and I had to take the initiative to find out what happened. That brought a lot of inconvenience and it's close to Christmas, I may not be able to get a replacement present in time. Elysha was helpful and courteous nonetheless. Great customer service."
Liam was incredibly helpful!
Had an issue with a delivery of a product not being made secondary to damage to the package during delivery.  I worked with Leith in customer service and he was extremely helpful in fixing the problem.  Can't say enough good things about the quick and thorough service he provided.
Elysha was efficient and helped me resolve my issue with little friction. Would definitely say it was a positive customer service experience.
"Great sevice, fast and helpful 😊"
Nigel was very understanding & very helpful & polite
Craig was sound but the company rules are absolutely sh*te. Can't refund any item that wasn't delivered for up to 14 days and you're expected to reorder again rather than just the same order re-sent. Luckily Craig was nice but overall makes Asos look muck
Resolved my issue very quickly and professionally. Thanks Ryan!
Elysha was helpful and got back to me in a proper time
Great customer service!
Was very helpful
Very friendly and very helpful took time to look into my issue & resolved as far as what was possible :)
Hanan was very helpful.
"Helpful,quick,effecient and above all very friendly and informative. Could not have asked for anything better honestly :)"
"awful customer service from Rebecca, very snotty and unhelpful. I have tried to pay extra for next day delivery but they wont let me do this. On completing my order it said it would be dispatched in the next 3 to 5 working days. I ordered on a Sunday. When I received my confirmation email it said the order could take up to 10 days. I am due to move house in 7 days from the Sunday I ordered. So my ex landlord will have a field day with the £494 of Christmas presents. o well done ASOS. Its caused me to have panic attacks and my stress levels are through the roof. I will never order with them again. Just feel"
"Very slow delivery, ordered on 29th November and haven't received anything yet. Contacted ASOS via Facebook messenger as was suggested on their 'contact' page but haven't received a reply."
Quick and Easy. Spoke with an agent called Yusuf and he dealt with my issue very promptly
The support was excellent
Helpful and kind
thank you. excellent
Mohammed what a great help. Dealt with my order with no problems
Helpful and Excellent
Great support
Johnny was great . He told exactly what I needed to do to fix the problem. And answered all my concerns.
Craig was helpful!
Asos is the No1 site for clothing! Asos has the best customer service!Delivery time always is accurate!!!
"Very frustrating, didn't listen to me. Ended the chat before I finished, just because she was, that was the end of it. Both know my order is not going to arrive, but I have to allow another day just incase its going to suddenly dispatch and be sent and arrive at my house tomorrow. All know that won't happen...... Useless."
Extremely unhelpful
"Emma, was straight forward, honest, and helpful. I've never had a great experience via chat so this is a first. Thank you!"
Ryan was very helpful and efficient. He solved my problem and exceeded my expectations.
"Great customer service always, very impressed with the speed queries are dealt with well done asos"
Was helpful in a timely manner
She was quick and helpful.
Good job Asos
"Disgusting customer service! Waiting 10 days for an order which hadn't even left their warehouse, not even an email to explain this. I had to call to ask them and the only response I got was 'I dont know where this is' which clearly is not good enough! I then recieved an email to state itll be delivered on the 9th of december which by no surprise it hasn't turned up!I havent had a single response to 1 of emails which I have sent 4 all together throughout the 10 days simply asking where my order was. The fact I have had to still wait for my order when I knew they could of sent this to me next day delivery when I called and complained but they didn't want to fork out on £6 which is highly embarrassing! Personally I wouldn't bother buying from asos you will be left with nothing and no explanation as to why!"
Very helpful! :)
Very helpful and fast customer service
great customer service....extremely quick and helpful and responsive
Excellent customer service from Francesca. Great employee to have working for Asos.
"The website itself is nice and offers quality clothing but the items themselves as with any site can be unreliable and thus need to be returned. For Canada at least to return any items in order to get a refund costs $22.44, which is pretty unreasonable if the item were to be worth $10 or even $40. because then the refund us only covering half of what you had to spend, it is a waste ordering from this website because if there was a need to return then your just wasting more money."
"Fast service, dealt with my issue promptly"
Great customer service when you're unsure of something. The chat option is quick and easy.
Unhelpful customer service
Aaron was awesome!
Thanks a lot to Christopher for quick feedback and appreciate his efforts and support
I'm very satisfied with the service!
Thank you for your quick cooperation
"great experience with shopping items and staff, hate DHL delivery, charged me $140!!!"
Seamless service.
chat reference is 23737766.Hannah was very rude.did not give answer to my problem.tried to end the conversation quickly and closed the chat before I was ready. did not help me at all. did not check anything for me. treated me dismissively and disrespectfully.
"Connor was so helpfull, i was very worried and he explained everything for me. Also, it was very quick."
Very quick and helpful
Always a pleasure! Great service
"Horrible customer service, absolutely unhelpful! Policies are awful, not buying again from ASOS."
"The customer service associate was great. Unfortunately, he did not have any resources to help me therefore I am unsatisfied with this customer service overall"
This is some of the best customer service I have ever received. Elliot is amazing and helped so much. My package was stolen off of my doorstep and ASOS has been able to resend me the items to my work address to avoid any theft.
thank you for the help
Rebecca was a great online helper and helped me get my order refunded. She was nice and helpful. Love Asos!
Really quick response and very friendly customer service!
Very quick and useful service to reserve a not so easy issue.
Very helpful and willing! His courtesy is & was well appreciated so I hope he gets the appraisal he deserves!
"ASOS consistently provides efficient and fair customer service and recently have begun using electric delivery vehicles in the London congestion zone - hopefully they'll roll this out everywhere. There are perhaps some issues with quality of items at times, but that tends to happen with cheap clothes (that's an incentive to shop more responsibly!)"
Alot helpful than previous person. Dealt with my query fast and efficiently.
Karman was very helpful and polite
"My items were lost, contact with customer service wasn’t possible for 2 days! No response to email!!! After 2 weeks waiting I was told next day delivery will be available within 72!!!! And I need to wait 24 hours for delivery to be confirmed in first place!!!! ASOS is a JOKE!!!!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!"
best costumer service! i love asos
"clear and helpful, I spoke to a woman named daisy who was clear about everything (as my parcel never showed up) and we came to a clear solution. only problem I could think of would be the long wait for the chat but other than that it was really helpful."
Very helpful
Emma took her time to understand me and my situation. Thanks so much Emma.
Customer service was great in resolving my concern with delivery of an order. Thank you Arnie for your assistance.
"Few delivery issues, online chat service dealt with well!"
Naeem was really helpful and a pleasure to deal with. What the courier company could't assist me with in 5 days she did in 16 minutes :)
Le correspondant est très efficace. Merci
Very friendly + helpful
Sterling service recieved by Reagan. Concise yet informative! Well done! A+++
Excellent customer service
Good understanding. Happy with it.
I've got 0 help
"ASOS can no longer get an item to me in 3-5 days it sometimes takes more like 8-10 days. I used to rely on ASOS for fast delivery.Also, they recently had separate discount codes for saving. If you spent over £80 you could use ‘COSY10’ to save £10, ‘COSY20’ to save £20 on a certain order value & ‘COSY30’ to save £30 on orders over £180 or something similar. I spent enough to use ‘COSY30’ but returned some items but they would not reapply the relevant code based on my final order value. Seems like a ridiculous way to offer a discount & they should have honoured the new code."
Nice quick and to the point
Lovely customer service Jade. She was lovely. Very polite and friendly. She was very professional
"I was in contact with the chat supporter Rem, which is really helpful! Thank you for great service!"
Francesca was incredibly prompt and so helpful in relaying to me clearly in terms of what happened to my missed ASOS order. I really appreciate that this company hires such great service providers. I was getting anxiety not knowing what happened to my order and was so happy to be able to connect with customer support Francesca right away who explained everything to me. I hope ASOS will always remember that the great people they hire for customer support is what really helps bring back consumers and improve their online shopping experience. :) You are so helpful Francesca!! Thank you!!
thanks for help!
Best customer care.5 stars
"Younis’s customer service was very professional, efficient and kind. I have had an issue with a specific delivery for a month now and he has been the only employee to actually deliver some sort of help. Very grateful for his service."
Sara from Asos was very helpful! I'm very pleased with her degree of professionalism and her kind and reassuring feedback!
Thank you to Mihaela for excellent service
I was wondering that ASOS have service for sending my order with a note / short letter in it. unfortunately they don't have such service but I completely understood :)
"Paid £200 for a north face jacket, it came with a rip in the bottom with the stuffing coming out. Tweeted ASOS hoping for an urgent reply as it’s a Christmas present, to then have no reply, emailed again and finally had a reply which was no help. Returned the jacket a week ago asking for a exchange as I want the jacket but a not broken one; still to hear nothing from ASOS which took two separate DMs and a tweet for them to finally get back to me with an answer."
Amy from customer service was really helpful. She made a couple suggestions to fix the issue and waited while explored these and when the parcel could not be located dealt with it accordingly! Very friendly and helpful. Just hope my shoes now arrive!! Thanks!
Great customer service
Sam was a great help in reassuring me that my order was in process :D
not helpfull at all.
Quick and positive response to my query
"Stole £400 from me. I have the collect+ receipt saying that my return has been delivered, and they refuse to acknowledge that my parcel has been sent to them. I spent the last week messaging every day on facebook messenger for them to ignore me most days. On the only day they did reply, they said that they hadn't received my parcel, which is a straight-up lie as Collect+ said they had delivered it. They didn't even check the receipt that I sent them. They say they'll reply within one hour, but I waited days for them to get back to me."
Becky was great! Solved my problem in less than 2 minutes.
great customer service
Sophia was extremely helpful with my query and provided all the information I needed! Very polite and quick service! Thanks Sophia!
Sara was Very Helpful with my issue regarding a jumper I had ordered. extremely helpful customer care!
"Polite, understood problem quickly, made to feel at ease"
Unreliable postage as they use a terrible courier service despite numerous complaints from customers. Returns are processed very slowly. I don’t know what’s happened at Asos in recent years but it’s nothing like the company I used to know. Will avoid making any further purchases it’s like throwing money away!
"Delivery getting worse and poor customer serviceAfter multiple issues with my delivery either not being delivered at all or next day delivery not happening, I tried to seek help from their chat bot and the person helping me was very blunt and left the chat halfway through me explain the situation. Ridiculous, and ASOS don't do anything to compensate."
Krishna is lit
ASOS customer service are always very helpful naturally mistakes happen but the customer service team sort things out quickly thanks penny
I find this whole chat system to be very robotic and not personal. I don’t like the automatic responses. I had to keep the chat active for 25 minutes to wait for an answer to one question. It’s honestly tiresome and tedious and they need a better way of communicating with their customers.
ASOS changed their standard delivery times without informing anyone. This means my Christmas order is coming much later than expected. There has been no correspondence or assistance from ASOS in resolving this issue.
"Hasan was very pleasant but he of course had to adhere to asos regulations which weren't very flexible. I made two very reasonable suggestions on how they could resolve my issue. Briefly this was: their delays meant the recipient will have left the country before that time came. I couldn't alter delivery address even though they'd not yet prepared the package. I could order again and send the original package back upon arrival but it had gone up in price and they wouldn't honour the original price paid.Bit of a shame as I assumed asos would be more like amazon in that they clearly value the customer over everything, even if they take a bit of a hit but sadly not."
bon dialogue
Vlad was very helpful as I was concerned about when my order would arrive he assured me I will receive an email soon and that it was due to be delivered tomorrow. Fast and effective very happy :) x
Good overall experience
Best online customer service I have received. Anna-Marie is ace!!
The Customer Care Team was very helpfull and efficient solving an issue with my order.
Kate was super helpful :)
"I never received my parcel but it's deemed as delivered by the shipment. I handed to ASOS online chat, satisfyingly the customer service provided very professional and efficient help by giving the options of refund or replacement. Thanks for the assistant."
Always great service and very reliable! Thank you!
"Really helpful online chat team, sorted my request very quickly and efficiently. Spoke to Paige, and she was very helpful :)"
"Usually I have no issues but had a missing delivery. Took some time to sort out, I’d advise using the instant chat rather than email or messenger options. All sorted now. Not be deterred from ordering again"
"No resolved my problem, but tried"
Quick and helpful
"Adil was very helpful and quick to respond to my query, great start to my Monday morning. Thank you Adil :)"
"Very good online chat with Renato, he was friendly and quick to respond to my request."
"Always been a loyal customer, recently took the plunge and decided to pay for a year next day delivery. Ordered maternity clothes last wednesday as I am busting out of my normal clothes. It is now Monday and still nothing. Tracked my parcel, it has been at the depot for days, it has been out for delivery a couple of times, just nobody has delivered it. Now back at the depot. Spoke to their online customer service who advised my to ""give it till thursday""  when I said this was unacceptable he promptly ended the chat. There is so little maternity available on the high street that online is my only option and asos has let me down big time"
"Both Support representatives I've spoken with, were really polite and willing to help. But for resolving my problem I had to contact you too many times because of your returns policy on incorrect items. First of all I had to wait many days for receiving my item and after realising you have sent me an incorrect item, I had to contact you 4-5 times to get everything done.  For those cases you need to review your policy, if you actually care for customer satisfaction.  Now you are making the Customer spend time and money for ""fixing"" your fault.  The customer needs to place a new order, pay for it, create a new returns form, pay for it and go to the post-office to send you back the incorrect item and wait for approximately a month for receiving a refund.  This is not acceptable for something that is your fault."
"Quick, polite and most importantly helpful!"
Satisfied customer!
I chatted with Joanna this morning who was really helpful and even took the time to explain how to turn on the notify me options.
Always very efficient and helpful
Use ASOS more than 2years. And order more than 200 orders. The live chat always give help when I got problem. Is happy to buy the fashion and cheap clothes from ASOS. 5stars recommences :-)
solution rapide top!
All best. I recommend!

Becky was really helpful and kind
Qasim was very efficient in dealing with my query/concern.  Thanks for your help.
Quick feedback and problem solved in seconds. Georgia was extremely helpful!
Mihaela from ASOS instant chat was great help!! Thanks :)
"Wanted to return some items bought on black friday that did not fit, and they were SO helpfull.Really good service."
I never have a problem with ASOS. If ever I have an issue with deliveries they are resolved super fast - thank you ASOS!!
Thameena's response was very prompt and the tone was very polite.
Safina was very helpful with the informations about the return! Thank you very much!
Celina was a great help.
Very helpful and my problem was sorted.
"ive Been shopping with ASOS a while and I do honestly love ASOS, their range of products is great, I shop there that much that I use the free next day delivery for 12 months....but this is where they lose points but due to using Hermes who are getting worse it’s 50/50 if I get my parcel the next day, some orders just lately I’ve been waiting 3/4 days and I’ve even had my parcels left on a different garden :/ if they didn’t use Hermes they would be 10/10"
Very quick and easy. I always use the chat its so simple and always get my issue resolved.
they really helped me out with my missing items. thank you!
"Had premier delivery for years now. Ordered item for a birthday gift on thursday. Delivery on Saturday. Failed on delivery, desite being in. Customer service shocking."
Told Chelsea about my refund that hasn't been received yet and she sorted this for me very quickly and efficiently.
Becky from ASOS Customer Care was super helpful and answered my question quickly!
Marie was very helpful 😊
Good response from asos team👍👍👍
"Customer service is a joke. They don't have complaint/dispute option anywhere on their page. Do not buy. Waste of money and time. I still haven't met one person from their customer service who is capable of resolving problems. I asked Thomas how can I raise a dispute, and the answer I got was that I can write in chat and they can pass my feedback. I want to start a dispute not give feedback! Am I not legally allowed to do that???"
Should improve your delivery partners in Kuwait.. They suck
Good site and quality generally okay just the delivery is getting worse. You use to be able to order standard delivery and it arrive within a few days now unless you pay for next day or premier member you have to wait well over a week. Your order isn’t even looked at for days. Getting worse
I am very pleased with the site as well as the quality of the clothes and shoes and of course the beauty of the products and your service as well as the fast delivery I am very pleased and will continue to order from you
She gave a satisfactory answer.
Amazing communication skills and very helpful! She kept it real and told me exactly why this issue was occurring and gave me some instructions on what to do If the issue remained. The best help service I have received so far!
Good service
"I got a damaged item as part of a package. I contacted asos help center and after a short time I have got the answers for my questions.As a result, I sent the package back and got refunded for the item and also for the shipping fee easily with no problems, the asos help center team was wiling the help me through the facebook massages interface with everything"
I had an issue with my return and Mrs. Jasmine in chat did her best with this and helped me to figure it out.
"The help was fast, clear and easy to understand. Well done."
Jerrome was super helpful! He was able to honor the 30% discount code that I used for the Black Friday sale. Very kind!
Best service award for Misty! Misty has been an exceptionally understanding and thoughtful customer service officer. I took up much of her time but she was patient to explain everything clearly and in detail.
Great & helpful
reviewedddd
Jerrome was very helpful and very polite! Helped sort out my issue in no time. Great job!
Good support
It was really helpful
They send you the wrong item and then don't offer any compensation for you having to take your time to ship back their mistake.
"Super fast feedback, and very supportive."
Got the order wrong (half the items missing) but customer service legitimately went out of their way to solve it within my timeframe for me.
Its a awesome website to soend a money in without  frear about quailty
"I really love the clothes from ASOS and I've ordered from here multiple times. This was the first time I didn't receive my order and when I got in touch with customer service, Ryan was very kind and helpful and offered to resend my missing items."
"had an issue with my order regarding a missing item. Was resolved swiftly, thank you!"
Great service!
When my package didn't arrive (despite FEDEX/Post Office saying it did) Rebecca was very helpful and sent a request for a replacement order immediately.
"CONSISTENTLY poor customer service from beginning to end. My parcel never arrived and went missing, the replacement parcel (missing multiple items) arrived split open. Further to this customer service via chat (thanks for zilch Robyn) offered completely nothing for their poor service and customer experience.Making a point to not order anything from ASOS again. Appalled by every touch point in the experience with ASOS. ASOS used to be good but has really declined.. this is further exacerbated by The Iconic's incredible service."
"Daniel's help was amazing! My package was delivered but I never personally received it. He was able to help me quickly, and offered to replace or refund my order."
"Asos has a great return policy and fast and free shipping. Ordered several wedding dresses and was relieved that I could easily return the ones that did not work. I was about to find the perfect one. It will need some alterations and additions because the material is a bit thin, but overall I’m ecstatic  that I found a wedding dress for $200. I searched several wedding dress shops for $1,000+ dresses and didn’t find one I liked as much as the Asos one. The size finder is great and all five I ordered fit perfectly. I wish that the website allowed for photo reviews so other brides could see how they look in person."
I paid for next delivery but 5 days after I ordered I have not received my pascal yet
Deanna was extremely helpful and very professional
"Simple, easy and quick. Thank you."
"Quick, easy help. Thank you!"
"The process was fast, helpful in answering questions accurately and professionally."
Munawar was very helpful. I was able to cancel my order and re-order it using the express delivery option
Nadine in live chat very helpful and sorted problem very quickly. I had been emailing for days about the issue without success. Very pleased with Nadine
Great couldn't ask for more
Quick reply and resolved my issue easily.
i talked to Metin. He was nice and help me very fast.
"Emma was great! She was nice, understanding and quick.24396149"
"It was amazing, she was helping with everything. Told me all I needed to know, and very capably helped me out!"
"It was really difficult to get into contact with someone, but once I did I was very please.  I spoke with Nadine (24396702) and I am satisfied with her assistance.  I had an order that was unsuccessful and if I still wanted to purchase the items, the prices would be higher.  She assured me that I could reorder these items and that she would honor the black Friday discount I originally order my items with.  I am please to say that her help was greatly appreciated and I eagerly await my items!"
Great thanks for your help
Went like a breeze I appreciate her help for resolving this issue I had and I hope it goes through well.  - Survey for Deanna :)
"I only received one of two packages containing an order I had bought express delivery for.I connected with Ryan over the ASOS Customer chat, and he was able to adress my issues quickly and thoroughly, replacing my missing items and refunding my purchase of express delivery. No complaints, good service."
"No change of up-dating a delivery adress within few hour of ordering.  We are stuck with our order with wrong address and no way of getting a refund or change delivery methods.   No understanding at customer service just ""computer says no"""
Fantastic Customer Care team. Quick responses to emails and sorted everything out for me. Thank you
Asos chat support is so friendly and easy to use! Thank you to Jasmine!
Really great service when my own country's post system lost my parcel
Daniel was very quick with dealing with my refund he was very helpful and was able to sort it quickly.
"I really do enjoy shopping here and everything I get I'm in love with. My biggest problem is if I do buy something in the wrong size, I'm unable to exchange it for the correct size for the same price. It's ridiculous because the sale is over by the time I get my package and try on my clothes. I even paid for the 2 day shipping and still received my package much later than expected. I would be very pleased if I was able to exchange my order for the correct size for the same price. Kirsty was also not very helpful and did not sympathize either. Instead she said she could not do anything and offered to end the chat and overall was not very helpful."
Spoke to Daniel re my order - he quickly sorted out the issue which I was a little bit embarrassed about and gave me reassurance it would be sorted.I take that back. The issue never got sorted and ASOS were very UNHELPFUL following this they even said that I would have to resolve the issue myself which would INCLUDE me having to go back and face someone who was ABUSIVE towards me.
"It took a while to get through but once I chatted with Amy she was kind, helpful and looked into the issue for me - hopefully will get sorted in a day or two. Was easy to use and would use again"
Laura was really helpful! Just excellent!
Absolutely amazing service and response from everyone who has helped me resolve my problems . My wedding was recently cancelled from the Thomas Cook fiasco and I had to return my dresses for a refund out of the time frame which they’ve allowed me to do but not also refunded me in cash so that I can pay off my new dresses. Amazing service always hence why I will always use you! Thankyou again!!
Emma was amazing helped really quickly and got to the point
"I used to love shopping from ASOS but I ordered a sweater and It arrived wet with mold all over It as if it was kept in a damp basement floor, and the customer service representative Kathryn was not helpful at all"
Costumer assistants are very helpful.
"Out of 5 things I ordered I will return 4 (and still in doubt about the fifth piece). All things are very poor quality and do not match the picture at all. The coat I ordered smells really bad, is different colour and texture than the picture, it fits poorly etc. The sunglasses I ordered do not match the picture as well, they seem much bigger in real life. The bralette I ordered is complitely different colour and texture compared to the photo (in real life bright pink, in the photo pastel lilac). The belt I ordered came damaged and does not match the photo as well. The shoes I ordered are really poor quality. Overall, I am deeply disappointed and will not purchase anything from the website again!"
"Out of 5 things I ordered I will return 4 (and still in doubt about the fifth piece). All things are very poor quality and do not match the picture at all. The coat I ordered smells really bad, is different colour and texture than the picture, it fits poorly etc. The sunglasses I ordered do not match the picture as well, they seem much bigger in real life. The bralette I ordered is complitely different colour and texture compared to the photo (in real life bright pink, in the photo pastel lilac). The belt I ordered came damaged and does not match the photo as well. The shoes I ordered are really poor quality. Overall, I am deeply disappointed and will not purchase anything from the website again!"
Very operatives and with care for customers!
No issues. understood my question well and helped me out nice and efficiently.
very good service
Prompt and helpful service when locating an order that hadn’t arrived.
"I returned an item 13 days ago and hadn't had an update. The courier picked up the item 12 days ago and ASOS still hadn't received it. I initially sent an email and Jerome stated that it was picked up yesterday, despite me sharing a screenshot confirming it was picked up well before. I was worried that I would just be brushed off, so spoke to someone via Chat. Paul, who was assigned to me, was very helpful and actually cared to review my receipt and understand exactly where my parcel was. He came across as keen as I was to get to the bottom of this. Thank you so much Paul, you provided brilliant customer service."
sort out problem quicklymy case is 24385917 and served by Kirsty
"ASOS customer service is second to none. Online chat with Deanna was so helpful, as are all of the other employees! I cannot fault ASOS for customer service"
Always very helpful!
very helpful
"Stephanie helped me with my faulty item very quickly, I am very pleased because I imagined this to be a more tedious process. Thank you for the help."
great service.
An eyeliner was missing from my order and I was able to request a replacement within a few minutes. The live chat was very helpful and super quick!
Yusaf was very helpful and attentive.
Though online customer service chats can be frustrating Yusef was able to take the time to help me out and get my problem sorted!
"An item was missing from my order. I emailed and was emailed back to say this was being looked into. The missing item was with me in a couple of days. Luckily, it wasn't something needed urgently!"
I have bought off asos many times and find them such a great company. So easy to order and extremely easy returns process when required. I was due to receive a parcel which the delivery company stated was delivered and signed for however I never received this parcel. I contacted asos via live chat and they were so helpful. So happy and it is a weight off my mind for the company to make it such an easy process.
Great customer service
Had an issue with my order arriving with some items missing which was annoying but I spoke to Yusuf who quickly sent me new items. Good customer service
The agent was kind and patient. I was waiting too long till we started to talk.
"Beth is the customer service officer for the day, awesome."
Selina was very helpful today sorting out my delivery issue.
Emily was very kindly
Hannah was clear and quick in helping me with my problem. They were friendly and polite. Thank you!
Great helpful polite service on chat from Thomas.
"Customer service on Twitter is the slowest I have experience for any company!Delivery is SHAMBLES! I ordered 9 items using my next day delivery on Wednesday 4th December at 7am. The items did not come the next day (Thursday 5th December).3 of my 9 items then arrived on Friday 6th December at 4:50pm. I called Asos customer services who said they would get the other items sent out to me and they would be with my by Sunday 8th December at the latest (she even said on the phone they could come on Saturday 7th December! but more likely Sunday). I asked the lady to change the delivery address to my home address as it was currently set to be sent to my work address which I am at on Monday to Friday. I then received an email today at 3am to say 3 of the 6 remaining items would be with me on Monday 9th December. The other 3 items are now out of stock (they weren’t when I ordered them!).I called Asos customer services again to ask why they are coming to me on Monday 9th December as I was told on the phone they would come today.The lady then tells me the 3 items in stock will be with you on Tuesday 10th December, not Monday 9th December like the email says! I also explained I will not be home in the week so to change the delivery address, however you are unable to change the delivery address back to my work address now?! I cannot believe this. You should be embarrassed.  I understand slow delivery and I could have handled all my orders arriving on Friday 6th December... or even today. But to now say it will be with me on Tuesday 10th December at the very earliest and that it could even take as long as the 16th December is ridiculous!Some advice - don’t use Hermes if they are being slow. It doesn’t make you look good at all."
"Customer service was great, had a guy named Taylor which helped me with my order. Without much delay he got it sorted for me straight away and was really understanding."
"I would give zero stars if I could. Non committal, unable to satisfy my complaint satisfactorily and no emphathy for my situation."
Very helpful and resolved my problem.
The advisor I spoken to was very prompt and professional. Resolved my issue remaining polite throughout. Thank you very much.
quick help from adil
The responses are pretty robotic and didn't make me feel like my personal issue was taken care of
always a happy customer with asos.
Amara was so helpful to gave me an easy ways to deal with one of my missing item I didn't receive itAlso was kindly show me an easy way to go and use the Saudi site for find my true shoe size. Thank you Amara.
"Was of no help,robotic attitude  and had no information regarding the manner. Pathetic service"
The usual terrible customer service from ASOS - the worst of all the online giants...
Did not received my parcel. The asos customer service was really helpful and solved the problem for me.
"Bit of a wait to begin with, but excellent service."
Beth was professional and I really appreciate the assistance!
convenient and fast except this time
Speedy responses to queries and excellent customer service.
"Didn't seemed to be very reputable, was quite shocking about his/her grammar. Couldn't rlly help me. Maybe he/she was new in the customer service."
The order i placed did not arrive on time and asos chat service could not help to locate the issue where.They ended up issuing a credit for the amount ( still pending approval).Most probably i will not purchase from them unless they provide an efficient transport mean to sending to clients in israel with proper tracking results
Dominique was really nice and helpful.
the wait time on the queue is very long. Yesterday I waited about an hour and I still didn't get anyone to chat with.
"First order with ASOS and so far it's terrible. I won't ever put order again! In short: the customer service is terrible, delivery never attempt and tracker useless, supposed to be a next day delivery 8 days later still waiting! They refuse to allow me to place a new order (the parcel is in transit somewhere) at the sale price. the customer advisors cut the chat 3x on me!!!They are useless, gestion is terrible, they don't reply. Everything is made to build frustration. They send you copy/past that are not relevant. It's an international company, well known and having funds but they can't even put a bit of money on customer care issues, RIDICULOUS. WORSTE EVER If you want the full story:My order has been placed to be sent in the evening, the courier never came. In the email I've received it's stating they attempt 2 delivery before sending the parcel back to the sender; Tracker not updated for 3 days (I've paid £8 for a next day delivery) and here is the nightmare of the customer care beginning:You can't call the service so you get this choices:-  messenger text with automatised reply - useless and no one will reply don't waist your time- email - no reply- text chat I've been in contact with 5 different persons through the chats, and it just got worst and worst;First one is asking me to wait at least one day (so a next day delivery not received and a tracker not update for 3 days is not sufficient), ok then I'll wait!Second person, is sending me copy/past of random things I already know, I've been trying to explain to her for 20 min that I'm asking for my order to be re-issued and she CLOSE the chat on me and send me an email stating I'll be refunded!I reply straight away asking to not refund but to re-issue the order (sale order) no reply;Go back on a chat get no one replying for 15 minutes and then get cut out;AGAIN on the chat end up with a person telling my order is already in Warehouse (which is not) and they can't do anything. I ask to place a new order with the same price and they refuse without any reason. Get the chat CUT ON ME AGAIN.On the chat again - what a joke -, same b*llsh*t again!!! Send a screenshot showing they should attempt to deliver twice, the person reply ""your email doesn't show your order"", LOL that's your templates go and ask you marketing team to change this!!! They say my order is at the Warehouse - which is not and I will be refunded in 7 day, but then the opposite it's still in transit and will be refunded once received. I'm losing my patience and now only copy past just as they do, over and over again - might takes me a few years before I get someone competent.Go back on the chat and get some one sending me the same things over and over again.They don't even read what you asking, they don't even know what they are doing!"
I didn't get half of my items in my delivery but customer service was quick (girl called Amy) and it was so easy to get the issue fixed.
"Worst costumer support ever, I am gonna post reviews in every available location for the bad service I got. 2 packages on mine got lost and no one wants to give me answers."
My order was lost between asos who has the correct address and the delivery service who potentially had the wrong address. Asos managed to sort out the issue and were very helpful. Customer service is great!
My Christmas items were damaged and sent back. They couldn’t resend them which is really annoying!
Greame ... legend
Very helpful customer service!I was put through to Amara on customer service who was very helpful and resolved my issue immediately!
good online shop but should have a phone number to talk to someone regarding any enquiries
"Easy to get hold of customer support for help (Rem (assistant who helped in particular), quick and helpful replies, solved issue quickly and easily."
Very responsive and helpful!
"Oliver was helping me with my 101 questions and queries today on the chat centre.  He was really helpful, its great knowing you can rely on a professional service when purchasing online to a different country in different time zones."
Very helpful in identifying and sorting out my problem.
"first and last time I'm going to order from asos! received a wrong order ! while I paid for express Delivery, yes I received it so fast! BUT NOT WHAT I ORDERED!"
"I have recently ordered a men’s onesie which was meant to be a Christmas present, upon arriving and after checking this item I can see there was a rip in the arm. After raising this with customer services the only option was to return this item for a refund and if I were to re-order I would need to pay for delivery and then get back in touch with ASOS to have this refunded. I do not find this process helpful since you would think ASOS would offer a code at checkout however there is no real help and i feel this is a massive inconvenience especially as I waited nearly two weeks to receive this item. Not happy!"
"Bad, don't bother with them, they will just let you down."
I am really appreciative of the support I have been given today by Bethany but overall have experienced a poor customer journey. My order has not been delivered and I have received conflicting information from the customer service team and DPD and through numerous contacts have been going around in circles. Bethany was great and re raised the query but don’t think customers should be caught in between the Asos/DPD debate making the length of time to resolve the extended. I also think it is poor practice to have managers who are not customer facing in this instance. Thanks
"ASOS is great until you actually have a problem! I’ve spent the best part of 4 days now trying to contact someone, worst customer service I have ever experienced, think this will be the last time I shop with them."
Very helpful with relatively quick reply.
"Why doesn’t your company ship the goods in the order of payment? I don't think it's fair that we made orders before other customers, but had to wait longer than those customers."
Great customer service by Courtney!Thank you very much!
ASOS is always quick to resolve any problems-which is rare as I routinely never have any problems with ASOS as opposed to many other online store!
Never order something on next day delivery if you actually need it the next day as it’s guaranteed not to show. Customer service not forthcoming in refunding the next day delivery charge.
very helpful and quick to sort the issue
Dealt with both Denisa and Martin on your online chat regarding an order which said had been delivered but had actually not arrived with me.. both were extremely polite and helpful.. keep up the good work guys!
"Quick response from customer service, and hopefully the issue has now been sorted"
"When you order a pair of Ugg Boots over two weeks ago, the wrong pair sent out twice??? Customer care team have you on hold for ages then put the phone down! Then they say to send them back for a refund because there’s a problem? Yeah there is! How hard is it to get a number right???? Obviously very hard"
Very friendly and quick answers with right information!
I ordered a parcel for an event on 7th December. I ordered it to be delivered on the 3rd. There was a problem with delivery (Hermes) so it was sent back. They say they will try to deliver up to 3 times after that. Nothing. All week. The event comes and I have nothing as that parcel was for the 7th. I try and contact ASOS all week and get nothing back. I finally get the online chat working and someone called Talia speaks to me. They help me out but say I have to wait until the 9th to get a full refund on my parcel because of the contract they have with Hermes. The outfit I ordered was specifically for the event on the 7th and could not go because I did not have my parcel. Hermes say they will try and deliver it up to 3 times but no attempt to delivery was made but yet I still have to wait until the 9th to get a full refund. Not happy. I use ASOS all the time and this is the worst experience I have had with them. I like ASOS hence the 3 stars and Talias help otherwise it would have been less.
"Quick and simple to use. Even simpler to return. And Even when there have been mix-ups or mistakes, they’ve been very friendly in dealing with resolving the issue."
Customer service were very helpful having order that has been held up with carrier company resent. However there should be more options than only being able to deliver with Hermes. Item ordered on next day delivery over a week ago and still not out for delivery.
I would prefer having a section on the website/app to track the status of my returns instead of waiting 8 minutes to chat with someone.
Hannah was very helpful when I chatted through customer care.  Hopefully my issue has now been sorted regarding my recent order.
Got help i needed. love it
Bit slow to respond but helpful.
"Currently dealing with my request, but have dealt with it in a way that gives me confidence. The advisor was calm friendly and helpful. Hopefully my issue is resolved. I’m sure it will be."
Was able to answer my question and provide info on order tracking
Great experience and great customer service if needed
Thanks for your help giving me my lost student code!
Raouf is a great representative for your brand.  Efficient; kind and eased my anxieties about receiving ill fitting shorts for a vacation in a week!
Very friendly customer care
Very bad services
"I was sent the wrong sneakers in the same size as I ordered.  It seemed to similar to a bait and switch to me. Asos sent me a cute pair of sneakers, similar in some respects to the ones I ordered hoping that I’d either like them enough to keep them or too lazy to return them...  For my first ever order I’m so very bummed and disappointed.  Glad they were for me and not a gift."
"Had an issue with a refund, filled in a returns faq form and was put through to Charlie on chat. He was polite, helpful and was able to sort the issue in a very timely fashion and process the remainder of my refund. Great customer service."
Bad explanation and communication. They have been using already made answer and apologize for the confusion cause using those automatic answer. No help got.
"Although one of the item from my order was missing, I’ve contacted ASOS through live chats and one of asos operator(believe it was Nigel ) within no time solved that for me  and requested for a refund-need to say Customer service on the top level."
"The chat was great, just angry that my package was not received by me. First time shopping with you all and it was not a great experience!"
Your customer service was helpful. My package was not received. Upon tracking the address it was delivered to was not mine. Thank you.
Paul was very friendly and helpful. He solved my problem right away.
Great customer service!
"Quick response, quick resolve!"
Kirsty was great and sorted out my refund strsight away thanks so much
Very excellent service!
Charlie was quick to respond and made the repurchase so easy! As long as I receive my package shortly I still choose ASOS as my go to shopping spot!
I was helped by Leith today and his customer service was very good! Thank you so much for explaining everything to me so well.
"I had a few delays with delivery times and shipping, but generally understandable considering it's the week following black Friday. Customer service on live chat was very helpful and resolved my issue within minutes."
Kirsty was straight to the point and ready to help me out. She was nice and understanding of my situation and was easily able to help me out Im super satisfied and happy with this result and look forward to supporting this company still and referinh my friends!
"I have to say that you have very kind, operative, fast and dedicated to customer, employee- Leith."
Kristy was super helpful!
My purchased item arrived way ahead of time via Canada international shipment.  Thanks
"Three orders wrong within three months, no compensation for them messing up order other than saying reorder the same items and then sending back order, it has taken me FOUR DAYS FOR A REFUND TO BE SORTED OUT. Emails were ignored on a number of times really bad customer service, very reluctant to use ASOS again because of my experience of my past orders being messed up and now this chasing up a refund."
Very helpful with one of my items missing from delivery :)Thank you!
Great! Excellent service!
Order was wrong but customer service was very accommodating
"Order was inexplicably cancelled. The customer service representative left the conversation before all my questions were answered. The final message says a couple minutes passed, but that is not true."
the customer service chat somewhat helping and reassuring but didnt solve my issue. i am very upset i paid for and was promised next day shipping and my package is going to be delivered in 3 days. i feel as though my time and money have been wasted
"Ordering shoes from them, its a horrible experience! Because they use the UK sizes and I’m American. So If I order a US10, they always send me a UK9, which ends up being small as hell, and about the same size as a US9, so obviously not my size. I feel like you have to go up a size based on there sizing chart to actually get the right shoe size. But either way it’s annoying as hell being this has happened few times to me and don’t wanna have to remember to go up a shoe size every freakin time I order. So that whole shoe system alone could be better."
I hadn’t received my package and I chatted with Charlie and had everything taken care of!
customer service was quick and easy to resolve.  ASOS is one of my favorite companies and I am glad that they take care of their loyal customers
Shohaib answered to my question about returns very kindly and quickly
"Excellent services with the order placing, delivery and returns."
Johnathan was not only helpful but answered all the questions I had. Very sweet !
Jonathan was really patient and nice
"My order has been delayed, went into a live chat to get an update Tucn was of no help. Only thing he provide was this link. Im really disappointed with what's happened, this has never happened to me before, I paid for next day delivery intentionally to get the order the next day"
Took a very long time & 2 attempts to get a chat. Once connected my problem was dealt with quickly. Hopefully the outcome will be positive.
"Took forever to reply at first, but later progressed. Hannah was very helpful and suggested thing i should check, which i appreciate."
"Took forever to reply at first, but later progressed. Hannah was very helpful and suggested thing i should check, which i appreciate."
"Nigel, my customer service rep, was excellent. My package said it was delivered, and was not anywhere. I let him know and he was kind, understanding, and responsive."
After problem with One Day Delivery and live chat with Leith my problem have been kinda solved and I’m expecting refund. Thank you for your help!
very helpful and sorted the issue out straight away
The chat was extremely helpful and quick.
ASOS chat resolved a delivery blunder made by UPS quickly and efficiently. They delivered my package to the wrong address entirely ( nowhere near me)! Then had zero accountability nor any sense of urgency in their mistake. ASOS took the lead in investigating and resolving issue all via friendly chat!
"Had an issue with delivery, spoke to Jamal on the live chat who was able to resolve this in less then 5 mins. Great service"
Great customer service helped with my refund and nothing was too much bother Delivery always on time and good quality
Very helpful and sorted my problem straight away.
Easy to talk to when got through on live chat and solved the situation easily.
"The chat guy, Arnie, was great, reassuring and friendly! Really helped out with my delivery issue."
Delivery was missing items but customer service fix issue very fast and effectively
"I have ordered Asos products a few times and they have always been of high quality and good fit. Whenever I've had any problems or decided to ship anything back customer service has always been quick, friendly, and reliable. Overall a great shopping experience every time"
"I really like the brand, but the delivery is kind of slow in some countrys, cause I have ask for orders in US and the delivery is really fast and more explainful, and in oder countrys like Mexico the delivery is slow and without detailsAlso the clothes are really good"
Awful quality.Dreadful fit. Shocking customer service!
Quick and easy
An assistant name Doniquebreally help me sol e my issue with my delivery by being effective and effecient.
Nice Website! Nice goods!! prices have increased over time while quality overall decreased.. that's a shame.. The company is although great and I highly enjoy shopping online with them.
"replies are not very polite, missed out on some questions i asked"
JAVERIA was very friendly!
Erim was very helpful even though the matter wasn’t able to be resolved.
"Great customer service, delivery not so good"
Ella was extremely helpful and ensured that my refund was processed in a timely manner.Thank you for being so friendly and personable Ella!!
"I love Asos. I've shopped here for years, and rarely have issues with them. The customer service is always outstanding and quick. I pay for express delivery membership, so shipping is always lightning fast. However, I've had a major uptick in the amount of times items have been missing from my package. I don't think that this is necessarily their fault, but maybe if items were sent in boxes instead of bags, it'd happen less."
ASOS is amazing I love it. This review is about the appalling and inconsiderate customer service I received over the live chat. I feel as though the advisor called Thomas didn’t care about my misinformation by ASOS and my need for my order. Please read the full chat for further information. The chat reference is 24365898Thank you
"Knowledgable staff which dealt with my enquiry promptly, in full. Great that there’s different options to communicate such as social media and email."
"I received an incorrect item, a extra small crop top rather than a size 10 maternity dress. Rather than be able to directly help me I've been pushed around to different departments while the only item that I wanted is selling out. The company can potentially give me a code but with no estimate as to how long it'll take. All the while I'm sitting here with an extra small crop top. There is no contact number where I can call and speak to anyone directly other than the chat function which representatives can only give me the same information about returning an item which I can find online."
Delivery failed by Asos then had to pay full price to reorder item due to their incompetent courier How hard is it to get a parcel delivered to a DPD pick up Customer services useless wait 10 days for it to arrive back before refund?And order at higher price Thanks Asos now down over £100
Can never go wrong with ASOS
"Had some problems with delivery on the shipping company's part, but the customer service staff is incredible and they have helped me arrange a replacement! Thanks to Ben specifically :)"
I had to get a replacement dress due to original option having holes in the lace - customer service said *in writing* that they would cover overnight shipping on my new order so that I would have something to wear in time for a wedding! Now they are refusing to reimburse the shipping charges. Unfortunately they have lost a customer.  Very poor service follow-through.
Great customer support on live chat.
"Shannon was extremely helpful and efficient. No wasted time, just the result I wanted. Every experience I've ever had with Asos has been incredibly positive."
"I paid extra for my packages to arrive last week. They still have not arrived. So, what was the point of paying extra? I am not sure. Disappointed."
"Anytime I've contacted them (usually Live Chat), each advisor has always been so friendly and helpful, no matter the query! Have shopped (and spent A LOT) with ASOS, and will only continue! :)"
Very helpful and friendly service. Quick resolution and actual human responses (unlike Most robotic customer services). ASOS is probably one of the best customer services I’ve experienced
Really helpfulNiamh was really helpful - I had so many questions and she answered all of them helpfully and efficiently. Thanks! Great service!
Rhiannon was very helpful with helping me with my returns Everything was settled very quickly.
"Delivery is a bit bad lately, but customer service in the chat is always helpful."
Very helpful and went out of way to help me! Thank you Denisa
"Charlie was nice, quick and a pleasure to speak to. I requested a refund for a faulty item after providing some photos and explanation and a resolution was instantly given."
Rem was extremely helpful and dealt with my query immediately.
"Javeria from live chat demonstrated an excellent customer service.It is so rare finding a company with a great customer service, who listens and genuinely tries to help instead of seeing you just another number. It is very impressive that a big brand like Asos can offer such an amazing customer service. Mistakes can happen, especially this time of the year, but I am really happy how your customer service trying their best to make it right again. Thank you."
"Utterly farcical, waited 5 days longer than the specified delivery day which I paid extra to have, after spending 2hrs+ over 3 separate occasions, finally found out that the delivery never even left the warehouse. Received unintended emails asking me to return the delivery I never received, was told I couldn't get the refund for the premier delivery service at the same time as the refund for my clothes,because a specialist team need to process it! Then the advisor dropped the chat window without resolving everything. This is a disgrace of a business on all fronts and I have absolutely no intention of going anywhere near them again. I'm only hoping they don't mess up the refund of the delivery charge, and I need to go through the only terrible channels of communication they offer."
"Terrible service. Lost my return package. Apparently It's a well known problem that they loose packages all the time, Unfortunately I didn't know that and this time I forgot to retain the evidence. You would think that they would document the return label that they include with your order in the event that it gets lost but nope they have no clue!   It's really put me off shopping on there again. It's always better to shop at brands who value you not put you out of pocket for over £100. It might be a small amount to them but its not to the average customer."
All is good. Thanks
Took a while to connect but got the answer immediately once connected! Very polite and friendly customer service :)
Slow to get someone connected but otherwise great service!
very very helpful and quick
Such a quick and efficient service. Customer care solved everything so quickly and pleasantly.
"Even though I got my Dr. Martens in wrong size, I am very happy with the overall experience. I would like to thank Raouf in Customer Service who I talked to on your live chat. It was a very pleasant experience and I got all the info I needed. I love the fact that if I get a refund because the boots I ordered are not in stock I can still get them replaced afterwards for the same price I did the first time (since they were a Black Friday order). That is an example of great care for customers and I will surely buy on ASOS again."
"Rebecca was absolutely lovely and extremely helpful. My experience with Asos' customer care wasn't great, but Rebecca did her job well and helped me with my issue."
"Worst company I have ever dealt with. Used to order from them a lot a few years ago but stopped after getting fed up with delivery problems and being sent an expensive wool jumper which had clearly been shrunk in the wash. Customer service were a nightmare to deal with and they never refunded return postage for faulty products. The company was more hassle than they were worth.A few years later and I decided to order a christmas present for a family member from them on black friday. Big mistake. They took payment and dispatched the order. However, the order has been marked as delivered despite no attempted delivery to the address specified on the order, no correspondance from the courier (fastway) and no indication as to where the parcel was left. This has happened purely because they have chosen to use the worst courier company available. Anyway, I emailed them 3 days ago expalining the situation and asking for the order to be delivered to the correct address or for a refund. They haven't even bothered to reply and there's not even a phone number for customer service. I'm now left without my order despite having being charged and these guys don't even have the courtesy to reply to my emails. Save yourself the hassle everyone. I won't be ordering from ASOS again.At this point, I'll now either have to decide whether to get paypal to action a chargeback or take them to small claims court for the money they have taken from me. Honestly, I don't know how so many people use this company. Their prices aren't cheap ( generally you can find same products cheaper elsewhere unless on sale). Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They use the delivery company (fastway couriers) with the worst reputation and they ignore consumer law."
Excellent customer service
Great customer service
Asos customer service have never done anything but be awesome with me they are great to loyal customers.
"Friendly staff, my problem was solved within minutes.Thank you!"
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
she is very nice and patient
"They can be awful when it comes to customer service but Shannon was brilliant. After waiting 2 weeks for a delivery and refund issue to be resolved and after speaking to 12 customer service members, she sorted it after taking the time to read all previous history!That's the reason I can't give 5 stars - it took 2 weeks to resolve an issue but when it gets done right it's all good."
Very informative and polite ! Good experience with Graeme
Very poor experience unfortunately  and very disappointing. Next day evening  delivery service that wont be used again as an option because my delivery never turned up. Also having to wait for 48hours for a response to find out where my delivery is or when it will be delivered to my is really not good either.
"Agent was very helpful and polite once I got through to one, gave me the answers I need to move forward with my query"
Stay well clear. Take extra money from your bank and customer service do not want to know.
Useful help - went beyond limits
Polite and kind
Ella was so efficient in her advice and she was very polite. I have had bad experiences with asos customer care and Ella has been one of the best i have come across. She deserves some recognition
Always friendly and helpful
fast and helpful. I'll check if the package really did arrive on Sunday
Sometimes is very difficult to get in touch by chat with asos staff. But this is the second time and the quickest to resolve my issue. Really good job. Quick and efficient. Now only waitting for the refund as it sholud be. Thanks for your excelent work
Jordon from customer service was very helpful
"I enjoy ordering from ASOS I just have a problem with finding the proper fit to my size which would help if you guys made a full fit guidance assistance by us putting our size on the system as well as the perfect fit for each item of clothing, cause each clothing has its own fit and measurements."
"really helpful through live chat. don't recommend facebook messenger even though that's an option through the website. message sat in chat for over two days. otherwise, a mix up in items got resolved immediately through live chat. satisfied! x"
ADEEBAH is the professional support!I love you :3
"I LOVE ASOS! I have only recently started shopping online. I'm an artist and work from home, so buying clothes has not always been a priority for me. However I had to attend a swish wedding so checked out all the sites. Asos is definitely the best in my humble opinion. I like all their brands, but I LOVE the ASOS brand..in terms of being incredibly chic, the colours, style and even the photography and poses of the models are better...other fashion sites seem really tacky by comparison. And the asos website is simple and clear in terms of graphics and text,, and easy to use. And affordable, especially with Afterpay. All my orders have arrived without a problem from the UK, and more quickly than sending a parcel from Tasmania to Sydney..I know this sounds gushy but I am absolutely thrilled to have discovered asos and won't bother shopping anywhere else, online or instore."
"Received a quick response from Jordon. Answered my query, very helpful indeed!"
Jasmin was super helpful. She helped me in no time and was super easy to work with. Glad that she was able to help me out today.
"Very easy to shop. Alot of the merchandise is in stock and in the correct sizes. The site has alot of options to choose from being name brand and unknown brands. Items are affordable and has good quality. Lastly, customer service is good. Fast communication through chat with clarification."
"Narina helped me with a mistake I made and was so kind and thoughtful. I have to say that she was not only wonderful, but having such wonderful customer service makes me want to continue to shop with you guys. Customer service can be a bit challenging at times and I have never once experienced that with you guy! I seriously love ASOS for this reason!"
"I was waiting for my parcel to come on on Friday, has ordered several things, the price was fair, and the number of goods I could select from was decent as well. Everything was good except for one thing, which has spoiled everything.So basically delivery must have come to the UPS access point, from which I would take my clothing. When I have checked where is my order, it was written that it is being returned to the ASOS! I was highly frustrated and disappointed and decided to in deep and analyze why it wasn't delivered and basically it was written that UPS station refused to take my order! I was shocked. Was calling UPS, no answer. Reached to the ASOS support, and they told me that my order is going to be refunded in 10 days...... I simply lost control, as I am leaving in 9days from the UK and needed this clothing urgently.I am very disappointed that I should order this clothing again, but at first wait for a refund, then try to catch my size in stock and then again wait for the order to come. NICE :)"
Live chat is unresponsive and does not provide any solution.
Best customer service
"Great help today, thank you"
"Sapphire was very profesional and useful, grate customer care"
"Hannah delivered fast and helpful customer service that made me not feel like another number but a valued customer.I'll continue to shop with ASOS, thank you."
Great quality clothes and customer service.
Fast and detailed answer getting with all queries issues. I have feelings save with return items and also order as well. I have definitely will choose ASOS to perchase next time with best promotional products line.
Great customer service and wonderful banter. Glad to know it’s not a robot.
"ASOS customer service is great. But FedEx stinks! I was home all afternoon and was excited to receive a maternity dress that I paid extra shipping for so I could wear it to a holiday party this weekend. FedEx says that they dropped it off at 2:47PM, but I never got a knock on the door and when I realized they said it had been delivered, I went outside and ... nothing! Thankfully ASOS issued a refund immediately."
"I have been a regular customer of ASOS and pay for premier next day delivery, but during this christmas period they have completely lost control of their business. Orders placed on 27 Nov have still not arrived and no updates have been given. It is christmas time and people are ordering gifts and travelling, and I have now run out of time to organise new gifts for my family. I have tried contacting ASOS on Messenger, Twitter and Email and have had no responses after several follow ups over the last few days. On social media I see a lot of people with the same issues. Not good enough, especially when paying an annual subscription for premier service."
Selena was an excellent representative for ASOS. She was very prompt and thorough. Helped resolve my concerns
Sapphire was very kindly and she gave me the best that she can.
"Agent was very polite and friendly. Used proper spelling and grammar which a lot of your staff lack. Clearly came from a redbrick uni. Give him praise since, Daniel is a star employee"
Very quick response and happy with the service.
I just wanted to ask some questions about some items I wanted to return and Hannah has been helpful and answered very quickly to my questions!
Liam was extremely helpful in answering my order questions.
did what they could
I’ve had a nice experience with this company.It was exellent.
Shame about the delivery service but very good customer service. Resolved the matter very quickly
He was helpfull and quick
I’ve spent thousands at ASOS over the years and had no problems. I pay for next day delivery.Today is Friday and I placed an order on Monday night. It was meant to arrive on Wednesday but I’m still waiting. After numerous unanswered emails and FB messages they eventually replied to one of my emails. Only to tell me to keep waiting. Two people have told me the same thing in different ways like I’m stupid. They’ve put in zero effort in resolving the issue except that I have to wait till Tuesday so see if it will be delivered or not. Then contact them again. So much for paying for next day delivery. This company is nose diving straight into administration. Needs to check itself before it wrecks itself.
"Ben helped me out today with my two missing orders, he was very understanding and extremely helpful. He made sure my items are being sent to me as soon as possible.Thank you Ben for helping out with the issue during this crazy Holiday season. If it’s not up to you guys the Holiday season would not be the same with the madness online shopping. Happy Holidays!"
"Awful everything. Never again. Would recomend you stay away.My girlfriend wanted some shoes for Christmas, I saw 2 pairs she wanted and waited until Back Friday to get them.The pair she wanted the most was sold out, fair enough, I'll buy the other pair as it is available.Proceed to check out and notice that if I add 8 euros extra, I get free shipping. So I add 4 little things and it's done.Now, today, the 6th of December, a damn week later, I get an email saying ""oops, actually we don't have the ones we said we did have, here is the money you paid for them"".So now I get back the money paid for the shoes, but now I wasted Black Friday trusting this company, will have to buy the same shoes at a more expensive price because they can't manage their stock and I now I still paid for 4 other products that I would not have bought if not for the shoes. Ridiculous.At least ask if I want to wait until they get back in stock or if i want to cancel my entire order, not just nitpick your mistakes away and the client harmed in the process.Terrible decision making behind this."
Prices are pretty equal to the quality you receive. Unfortunately my last shipment was lost but was sorted out very promptly and shockingly pleasant!
"I had a problem with my delivery but when contact costumer service by chat they were quick, professional and offered a solution for my problem."
Was very quick and really helpfull
Spoke to harry and he was very pleasant and very helpful thanks again
very helpful
SAFINA was an amazing at customer service and happily resolved my problem. She is a wonderful employee!
"Sara was really helpful, got the job done and overcame a few unique problems with my order to help me rectify a refund.Overall happy customer!"
I Struggle with online shopping and I was so grateful for how quick my problems were resolved
Didn’t honour next day delivery because busy. Customer service cut me off. Told they wouldn’t pass my feedback on and I wouldn’t hear back from my complaint. Awful customer service.
Horrible customer service.Ordered something Oct.17th and still hadn't received it 2 months later. No updates were given on the order throughout that time.Also was only given a refund after 2 months of waiting for the product and was still charged 30$ for shipping.
I have a purchase every month I think that says it all !!!! Asos team :)
Very satisfied with the work of CS
"Chatting with ASOS has been really good. They were able to resolve my issues fairly quickly. However, Hermes is a terrible delivery service - order was 10 days late and even though i had an email this afternoon confirming that delivery had been made, no delivery actually arrived."
"I tried using the chat application to talk to someone. But they didn't have any answers for me. Situation: I haven't recieved my package yet and after talking to FedEx, they advised that there's a note on my tracking that states that the box they received is empty. There's no contents in it. They advised to talk to you guys but your customer service rep advised that he doesn't have the answers at the moment. Your customer service rep was trying to contact FedEx  and advised to me that it will take 2 business days to get an answer back. I just called FedEx today and they gave me the answers I needed .  FedEx was great in getting the answer for me right away. I'm not sure why you guys need 2 business days to get a response from FedEx. It sounds like the business process is flawed when a customer can get an answer faster than a customer service rep.  I'm going to wait the 2 business days and see what the response is. Either way, It looks like It'll be 2 months before I even received my order which I paid extra for to get it shipped faster."
Great customer service
excellent and fast service! responds quickly and makes you feel confident about what he says! trying for 2 days to get in touch with someone and is the one who responded and helped me out a lot! thanks!
ASOS Donique. Awesome ! Solved my problem !
"Always a great place to shop, delivery is usually good when DPD has the parcel, Hermes not so much- but this is more a problem with Hermes.Customer Service always seem happy to help and informative.I would love to see reviews of products from other buyers to get a better sense of products as you can on other sites though.."
"Jazmin was SO helpful and sorted my issue out immediately. Very pleased, thank you."
Devarna was helpful. Apologised for me not getting the confirmation email.
"Dani was great on the chat to help me out, even when I was annoyed to begin with."
"Asos is great for its vast content, but be warned if your not prepared to scroll for hours asos isn't the shop for you"
"So, Ashleigh was wonderful, after talking to several individuals that were dismissive of my frustration Ashleigh was kind and offered insight about the situation. It is truly unfortunate that the issue with my order did no get resolved, but glad that Ashleigh took the time to validate my poor experience with ASOS."
Bought from them many times and Never had problem with shipping and returning items. Recommend.
"ASOS is probably the worst company I have ever had to deal with I have so many complaints because of their incompetence and rude staff but apparently there’s no way to make a complaint no one is willing to give you a head office email address, no compensation is ever offered no help ever given just rudeness from staff and your basically told to just deal with it"
Spoke to chelsea who was very helpful when i had lost a parcel in delivery. Excellent service!
My query was dealt with promptly by Kris putting my mind at ease.
"I had to connect to chat option twice, and I sent a message on messenger. I’m still not sure if I got the correct answer. I received an email stating my order was returned. I haven’t even received it yet - I did not return it. I’m told to just wait to see if it arrives on the 20th or dec. this is Christmas present and I’m suppose to just hope it shows up. How it’s it you can’t give a confirmation ? If it doesn’t show up I will be very upset and contacting Asos again!"
Rep was helpful and straight to the point. Great experience with customer service.
Always very helpful and the customer care from Lloy was extremely helpful.
Anna-Marie was really helpful!
Issue will be looked into and Kate was very kind!
the response was quick and my questions were answered
Very quick & professional answer! Top!
"Great, Fast service."
"Worked quick to help get my issue resolved, Vlad was great to talk with!"
Christopher was really nice very helpful!!!!
The staff Patrick was responsive and helpful in clearing my enquiries about my orders.
"Awful company.  Firstly, NO phone number to call...you have to email (long time to get a reply) use live chat (buggy as sometimes it never connects and times out and long waits) or use FB messenger/Twitter to which they never even reply to you.Returns take an excessive amount of time to be processed, deliveries miss their target dates and if you manage to actually talk to someone and complain,they just say sorry but do not offer any form of customer service gesture."
Super helpful and quick solution-oriented.
Helpful staff and prompt support when required!
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
Michael was very helpful!!!
Shinea was very helpful with my missing item in my order and arranging a refund very swiftly for me. 5 stars. Thank you
"Asos is nice and trendy, and the Customer service is wonderful.However only the parcel problems are sometimes bad.Except the Delivery issue, Asos is perfect!I will use ASOS too!"
"I paid for next day shipping for pants I needed this weekend. It’s 3 days later and I’m just now set to receive the package today after the date being moved twice. I won’t be here to receive the pants. Very displeased with that and I know it’s not totally ASOS’s fault, but Jessica from the CS chat team was very speedy in updating me on my package progress and refunded my shipping costs for me. I’ve ordered from them before and only had sizing issues, which was expected so that’s fine with me. Otherwise I enjoy the brand so far and think they have a great concept going, just need to get UPS on their ship list lol."
"Quick and easy, Talia was brilliant and answered my questions straight away. Thanks Talia!"
"After trying to get in contact with Hermes for a long time and not being able to speak to a human as soon as I spoke to Amy from ASOS she sorted my issue out in minutes. Quick and efficient, thank you so much."
Very fast and helpful
"Ell helped me so much with my problematic order situation, great customer service"
great thank you for all your help and support!
Thank you for the great customer service!
"Accidently sent my package to the wrong address, it was nice being able to hop on the website and livechat with a real representative to help me get things sorted out. Thanks again Shannan! Love asos ✨"
"Asos's customer service is WONDERFUL. Lily chatted with me to help me recover a package that was stolen from my building. She was so helpful and understanding. Although the stolen package was an unpleasant experience, I was so happy with the customer service and the help I got."
Very helpful
"Connor was polite, resolved my issue quickly and efficiently and made me feel like he was doing all he could to help."
Delivery service appalling - Falsified signature stating delivery made and no customer service response to explain what’s happened. No refund. Shocking.
This used to be five stars until I had a parcel go missing. Getting a response from customer service wasn’t good. But saying that after almost four days of trying once I finally got through. The response was quick friendly and very helpful
ASOS were and always are very helpful. It is Hermes I am disappointed in.
"Hibo was excellent and did everything they could to help. I am a little disappointed that in order to have my shoes delivered on time I will have to order a new pair with next day delivery. For convenience and environmental cost, the option of switching to and paying for next day delivery (from standard) would have been better."
"My order of more than 500EUR didn't get dispatched... I had to find out myself and reach out twice... a replacement is being offered and a refund, but nothing to compensate for the error and fact that I had to figure it out myself.  The items I order were already low in stock because of the Black Friday discounts, so I'm pretty sure I will not get a full replacement..."
Quick response and issue resolved -
"Lloy gave me a solution to my problem but didn’t seem very understanding at first, although I believe the fault was on your end with the delay and not informing me. However, if the solution works, then all is well and resolved."
"After raising a concern about the failure to deliver my parcel 4days after next day delivery was guaranteed, and no updates provided I reached out to ASOS and DPD. DPD finally informed me after I reached out twice that my parcel had been lost but all updates on the investigation would be sent to ASOS. ASOSs response (at 5days after the item was supposed to be delivered) was for me to reach our again because they weren’t sure what was happening right now and completely ignored my request for a new version of the parcel to be sent, with the sign off ‘hope this helps’ - the irony was not lost on me as ASOS have quite literally done absolutely nothing to help."
Very professional and helpful
I told Denisa my problem. The chain to my necklace broke after just 2 months. She offered me a refund or a replacement. I asked for a replacement and she requested a replacement quickly and efficiently.
Shocking. Twitter dm's aren't replied to unless you tweet them directly as well which makes the whole thing pointless and even if they do reply they don't say anything helpful. Tried the live chat on the website and it was potentially worse the girl replied but still didn't help me at all and used a load of incorrect English which isn't the biggest issue but looks so unprofessional. Just really unhappy that I'm being told 3 different things and still not getting what I asked to start with.
Resolved a customer issue.thank you
"Brilliant customer service, helped me a lot!"
Kris was extremely helpful and understanding of the situation. Great experience.
"I really love ASOS overall and think offers are regular and great. Premium delivery value is good but I have had a number of times when it hasn't paid off, whenever Hermes is used I NEVER get my items on time which is really frustrating when you order for specific events and timelines in mind."
Nice guy Patrick cheers
ordering was smooth but tracking my order has been non existent.
Really responsive and helpful team
"Polite and quick answer, thank you"
"Had an issue of hermes claiming my parcel was delivered when its not, spoke to 'samantha' via the live chat who rearranged redelivery for click and collect instead. Had to wait abit in the queue but she was very helpful and solved my issue!! advice: dont contact hermes, they're useless, contact asos!"
Helpful customer service chat.
"Great feedback , very polite and helpful"
Chloe Paige was brilliant!
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
Shannan was great at handling the issue. Very happy with the support. 5 stars!
I would have given no stars if possible. Have been dealing with my different members of the customer care team for approx three months and continue to have my issue unresolved. I have asked for the contact details of management and to date have not received them. Will never be dealing with this company again once my refund has been processed.
Thanks Owen !
Very BAD - do not shop with these narcasists
The representative was very nice.  I was happy to receive a thank you from her
I’ve always loved Asos but I’m not sure what’s going on. Everytime I order lately I have to chase a refund. It’s infuriating and time consuming and drives me mad! Today’s unhelpful person had no access to my return form and I’d ordered 19 shirts so I knew I’d returned 15 and kept 4 but he wanted way more info than I had. Unhelpful and then he cut me off! Previous attempted to talk to someone had them asking for more info and then failing to get back to me
delivery is always in point and customer service is always amazing.
"Jasmin was great. Sorted out my problem quickly and efficiently.  The only down side is the wait to speak with an agent.  The whole process was 30 minutes.  Cant fault Jasmim though, she was brilliant"
The agent was helpful and kind.
great service
I had a chat with Luke regarding the issues with my order and he answered everything very quickly and professionaly.
After initial wait Talia was very quick to respond and explained why my order was delayed. Talia apologised which was nice and was very pleasant. Thank you
"Unfortunately, I ordered a pair of boots and as soon as I tried them on the buckle snapped. ASOS offered to return or replace the item and will be even paying for the shipping costs."
Very disorganised and difficult to contact with an issue. Takes a long time for a reply.Delivery options are not honoured and when delivery reorganised refunds are not given on next day delivery options.
"Always a good experience with ASOS, delivery can sometimes take a while though :)"
My order was said to be delivered despite me not being able to find it anywhere. I spoke to a support agent and they are going to process a refund and were helpful with that but overall I was disappointed with my experience as a first time user as I spent a lot of time trying to look for a parcel which I was told was delivered. I do not feel like using this service again nor do I plan on recommending it to anyone in the future.
Efficient and friendly.
The issue was dealt with appropriately and quickly.
"Asos, a great shopping experience, easy to use and intuitive app/website plus next day delivery until...Hermes...why Asos, why? It nullifies everything good about you, especially that deal we had, you know the one where I gave you money in exchange for said next day delivery. The problem is if you promise something and then repeatedly renage on that promise (i.e. next day delivery left to Hermes who it seems just can't fulfil your side of the bargain) then why trust you?"
"Ordered something online never arrived, delivery company so rude. Lost two mornings work waiting on delivery and ASOS team couldn't assist with getting it on time but did refund me the delivery charge"
Great returns policy! Customer service is amazing
Daniel was very helpful in aiding me to find and resolve my missing delivery
Great customer service team with a shout out to Stephen who sorted my missing order!
Customer care was great but paid a lot for next day delivery and didn't receive anything nor have I received updates on my order.
Shannan & Talia aree very hellpfull
"Ordered 2 items on Sunday 1/12. Was supposed to be delivered on Wednesday 4/12. On Tuesday the delivery was moved to  Wednesday 11/12. Asked what was going on on messenger, chat, email and I have had NO response at all. Disgusting customer service. I know it’s Christmas time and it’s busy but a response would be nice."
Lovely chat - issue was my error and it was handled in a dignified way. Thanks for your help :)
very good helped
very slow and bad attitude
Quick response with a fast outcome
Great customer service.
"(Through no fault of ASOS) my order didn't get delivered. The post office lost it then returned it to sender. I asked for my order to be resent and was told ASOS would not do this.Instead I have to wait another 10 days (it's already been 6 weeks) for my money to be refunded and reorder. So I originally ordered in October and likly, with how long deliveries take over Christmas, wont get my order till January.The person I spoke with is going to organise a promo code so that I won't be out of pocket, (I bought the items on sale) so that's good, but otherwise this was a bad experience.The person I spoke to did seem to be genuinely trying their best to help me, which was the one redeeming part of this experience."
"Girl were great,But more stressed out about delivery people :("
Very poor customer service. Asked for an exchange and got a refund.Required item was always in stock.Appalling
Helpful and efficient customer services - thank you
My customer adviser was professional but friendly - sorted my issue out effectively also - Asos is great and stock a lot i love it .
"I Love ASOS, so easy to use and always get my money back when I return."
friendly and quick
Good and comfortable
alskeiruthsdfgfgeger
I pay a extra yearly fee to get the next day delivery service.....waste of money.  My last three deliveries have not.  Why offer the service if you don’t commit to it? Returned all the goods as arrived to late.
Very friendly
Daniel was helpful and pleasant. Thank you!
I love Asos! I recommend it to everyone. They have decent International delivery and the product videos are a nice touch.
"I really like the orders from here, everything’s really nice and in good form"
Lewis was very helpful this morning!
Vlad the rep was v helpful. Asos did not respond to my 3 emails so I am not impressed by this.
Navpreet was very helpful and answered my question. I love shopping with asos as the customer service is always brilliant! It’s why I keep ordering from them and will continue to.
"Rubbish, standard delivery 3-4 days but taken 10 days. When on live chat the order has not even been picked ordered 20th Nov received 3rd December. They state they are busy but still manage to get next day deliverys out on time. Standard delivery they put on the back burner. BOOHOO ARE SO MUCH BETTER. never using asos again after this experience"
They dealt with my situation really well. Thanks to Kate! She was amazing x
I am satisfied with the speed of delivery and customer service
The chat was fine
"Package never dispatched problem at warehouse. Parcel week late. Emails sent and same response each time like a robot, no one actually bothered to read the emails. Asked for it to be delivered to an alternative address as the address originally sent to was only convenient if the parcel had actually been sent when it should have been. This request was ignored 4 times. Had to travel to the original address 14 miles away to collect, complete joke lack of customer service. Didn’t deal with my complaint. I will never use again."
Really good and helpful customer service would recommend.
Just been on a live chat with Georgia regards an order and was very pleased with Georgia’s help very helpful and efficient
Krishna was great today and helped me with my refund an asset to the live chat team.thank you once again Krishna
"the package that i receive every time is in an excellent condition, also the customer service are very helpful and reply fast"
"delivery is usually fast, this time over 13 days, i did not realise at checkout. i contact them offering to pay extra ad change delivery to next-day but they refuse to do this. what a joke!"
"I ordered some trainers through ASOS. Was told I would have to be in to sign for them by courier as they couldn't drop parcel off at a Hermes drop off point (I work 9 - 5 and have used a drop of shop for my parcels with various other retailers). Parcel got returned to ASOS by courier because they failed to deliver (no surprise, I work 9-5 so couldn't sign for them!). Wouldn't use ASOS again, even when speaking to customer services they advised nothing they could do! Only use ASOS if you are unemployed or can teleport yourself from your work to your home and back again during the day"
"I never got my order which i completely forgot about because all my other orders arrived, ASOS never contacted me to find out if i got my order."
amazing eazy contact' loving brand
"Asos is a great company. The clothes are generally what you see on the screen and the sizing is usually spot on when you use the virtual help tool.  Delivery to second world countries is slow and sometimes you could be waiting for up to two months. Customer care is excellent. Although you have to wait for the delivery, customer care are always helpful and I have never lost money with asos although I never received some items to mexico."
fricking liars we just sent few dresses to overseas for our cousin and when they arrived they were asking for another $140 tax they didn’t mention the $140 tax and when we asked the customer service oh my god! they were soo rude and didn’t satisfied us. DON’T EVER BUY FROM ASOS
I am a regular ASOS shopper with premier delivery and have always had a seamless and great experience with ASOS! I did recently have a hiccup in which a portion of my order did not ship. The customer service team was super quick to respond and resolve the issue. S/O to Emma for being great and helping me out!!
I hope the overall customer experiencer can be improved. it took me 3 days to try to get a promo code sorted and I still haven't receive anything.
"Asos shoes brand don't fit as expectedAsos shoe strap was way too long , dont fit properly and make your shoes look weird."
The service provided was good. I'm just giving one less star because no solution could be found for my issue.
kind and helpful
Delivery issues but great customer service
"I had a delivery issue, unfortunately resolving it was out of their hands, but customer service was very helpful in doing what they could."
"Jamie Leigh  was amazing, thank you so much for your help and patience defintley an asset to the asos team!"
Sabrina was very helpful & friendly! Answered all my questions! Happy customer :)
"I ordered my order from ASOS and paid for express shipping, I got an email 2 days later saying my parcel would arrive 5 days after the estimated date. I then sent several emails to ASOS with no reply as if you pay $15 for express shipping you clearly need it by a certain date. I then used the chat function on the website and they refused to help me. After contacting 2 separate posting companies that have dealt with my parcel and spending 2 hours on the phone I found out that ASOS has not actually put express postage on my parcel. I will not be shopping with ASOS anytime soon. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING IF YOU NEED IT BY A CERTAIN DATE. I am now left without an outfit for my event and have to buy something new and then go to the hassle of returning my product and getting a refund."
"Great customer service experience once again, Thanks ASOS and Dani :)"
An awful experience from start to finish
Really quick and easy customer service on the instant chat
"Shohaib was really helpfull, hopefully the problem with order will be resolved ASAP. THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME"
My Customer Service Representative was extremely helpful and resolved my problem in a very efficient manner.
Been waiting for my package for 3 weeks now. They keep saying the delivery is estimated for tomorrow but it never does. Worst website I have ordered on!!
Poppie was great help!
"i was helped very well via the Asos chat, the customer agent was able to resolve my problem."
Very polite and the solved every problem I had with my return.
The customer service is amazing!!!
"Josh was cool, and tried to assist as best he could. Preciate the assistance."
"Terrible customer service. My husband, who rarely ever orders clothing online, loved and ordered a jacket he was so excited about. His entire order was stolen. He called Fedex, they had him contact ASOS, who said he needed to speak with Fedex and that there was nothing they could do. After being told to go back and forth between the two several times, ASOS finally told him he had to wait until the 10th before they could either start the refund process or resend his items. The jacket is said to be low in stock yet there’s “nothing they can do” for five more days? It’s not his fault his item was stolen. I’ve dealt with several other clothing companies who do whatever they can to solve your problem ASAP. This customer service is a joke. It was the first and last time we will ever buy anything from them."
Clarassa helped me so much amazing staff member
"Product purchased on discount, but not supplied.I purchased a pair of shoes in stock on sale, money was deducted then the order was cancelled due to no stock. Weird.Asos now won't honour the price even though the item is back in stock."
"Amazing service, and very patient and fast."
online chat is excellent for queries
Amazing customer service from Abbas was very understanding and helpful in the process of a lost package!
Customer service is great. I initially sent an email and didn’t get a reply within 24 hours so went ahead and talked with someone on chat and my issue was resolved.
I have been shopping with Asos for many many years now and it is always my go to for any and all items! Whenever I have an issue the customer service team are always prompt and super helpful! Paige in particular today epitomised that ethos! Many thanks Asos ☺️
I spoke to a lady called Emma excellent service
Best shopping site!
Impossible to get anyone in customer services to look into a late delivery. Took the money immediately but don’t bother if the parcel never turns up.
"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I EVER EXPERIENCED!I reported an IT issue that happened while I was making my order and the person Jame that was replying  to me in the chat was not going to report or investigate the issue .After that I asked to contact a manager and that agent just closed the chat !!!! No help !no kind attitude! No understanding towards the customers. I do have a screenshots of that chat and I will post them as much as I can , not because I’m trying to be nasty ,just cos I want them to think about people more, since people making their company successful!’POOREST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !"
Had a chat clerk Selina had did a wonderful job with helping me out in a troubling situation
Items missing from order. Navpreet resolved very quickly and efficiently
Great team. Thank you for immediate help every time when i need it! ❤️
Great customer service 👍
"My package is 10 days late , my requests for help have received useless, or no replies."
Christopher was very nice and super helpful!
Very helpful and sorted out the problem
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!. ZERO CUSTOMER DRIVEN!!!! THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO HELP, THEY JUST ANSWER THE F**i SAME QUESTIONS THEY HAVE POSTED ONLINE AND DON'T MAKE AN EFFORT TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. LITERALLY SUCK!"
very helpful and straight to the point loved every bit of it.
"Spoke to the super helpful Laura on customer support chat, regarding a missing/delayed return. Requested a refund for me without hesitation. Was totally brillo :D Thank you"
Brilliant service very efficient and helpful
Ordered 9 days ago and it still hasn’t even been SHIPPED yet
Fast reply! And nice customer service for sure.
Yet another delayed delivery and three guesses who the courier company are.... Yeo HERMES!! Again I have reported to ASOS and again their “customer service “ could not care less!
Great experience !!
Efficient and quick with my enquiry - happy customer
CUTE clothes at decent prices. Excellent variety of styles and sizes.
"I ordered 2 pair of jeans with a 34"" inseam. When I tried them on they were wayyy to short, so I measured them. The inseams were 10cm shorter than what it was supposed to be on both jeans!! And it was too tight on the hips, so it made my butt look really bad. BTW the jeans were from COLLUSION.I honestly feel scammed."
When placing an order it stated an earlier delivery date then email confirmation stated a week later date. Tried for 3 days to get in contact with ASOS to deal with this and was told nothing can do about it. Would not order from them again
Super Service!
Naeem was great and reassured me.
the customer service was excellent.
"I ordered on 30th november for christmas party dress, order never arrived, and they havnt even shipped it and its already 5th dec and they say its going to be at least an additional week before they send it?!?! Might as well not bother then as the christmas do has been and gone. Never expect this kind of service, think their clothes must come out of china if its now 3 weeks for delivery."
"Bethani was really understanding, quick and efficient withing rectifying this issue. A true credit to the the company."
Very helpful response
"If there´s someone who is attentive and caring is Gurzala, the person who attended me today. With such a patience, empathy and efficiency, took my case as if it was his.Thank you so much for your time, and for giving me hope with such a peaceful way. Thank you so much, i´m pretty sure you are nominee by employee of the month.Thank you, team Asos.Have the best day!Best regards,Maureen Cocco"
"chat was very helpful , thank you for attention :)"
BRILLIANT advisor - couldn't be more helpful.
Adam was fantastic help! What wasn’t helpful was no reply previous and not being able to email ASOS because their inbox is full....
I am very pleased with the delivery and the cusromer service !
"While I got answers to my issues, I'm sorry to say I did not find the customer service helpful at all."
"I spoke to Georgia today regarding my missing parcel, she was very helpful and sorted my problem very quickly and efficiently so thank you"
"I have been shopping with Asos for maybe 10 years. I erroneously entered the wrong delivery address and seeked their help in finding a resolution. I was quickly told that there are no options to resolve same and I would have to hope that the recipients rejected the package.This is unacceptable customer service for me. What if Asos made the mistake wouldnt they have to find a resolution? I expect more assistance from a company I have spent so much money with over so many years. It was my mistake, however there must be some assistance that could be provided for a customer who is at risk of losing their package.I am not shopping with them again."
very helpful & understanding
Good customer service and good prices!
really help me
"I spoke with two people. First person was called Elise, and the second Alison. The reason why I've rated highly was because of Alison. Alison was super helpful and amazing. I ordered my items on Cyber Monday with the premier delivery which I needed for Friday, obviously I know it might take longer than a couple of days so I patiently waited. It is now Thursday and DPD have said that my items are being sent back to ASOS and I just wanted to know why. One item size was out of stock of the size I chose and are now out of sale but Alison managed to honor the sale prices to me, which was extremely kind. 5* for Alison.Elise, however, was extremely unhelpful, rude and just closed the chat when I asked why my order had been sent back. I wasn't being rude, she just wasn't giving me any answers which Alison managed to give me. She also told me the only way I can get my items are to reorder with the out of sale prices...? Why on earth would I do that when this whole thing has been completely out of my power? She said she wasn't able to do anything about it, to just ""reorder my items if I want them"" and then just shut the conversation. All I wanted was to know why my items were being sent back. I'm a loyal customer of ASOS, and to be spoken to and treated like that is totally unacceptable. Thankfully Alison managed to make it a lot better for me.-5* for you, Elise."
"Michael was amazing and super quick, the issue was rectified before he even said hello. He's a keeper, just hope he's not that quick in other aspects of his life :)"
Delivery came on time but the item was faulty and damaged. Not happy.Customer service otherwise good!
"Awful experience! Had a nightmare trying to sort out all three of my orders and it still hasn’t been resolved. I had a reply to my first email but they didn’t resolve anything, just pushed me to the side. I have sent a further 4 emails which have all been ignored!"
"Customer care is amazing, due to anxiety I hate phone calls so being able to ask questions through messaging is amazing, thank uoi"
Francesca was extremely helpful and friendly. She was understanding of my concerns and did her best to find a solution.
"Excellent customer service, thank you Kris!"
Azeem is a monkey anus.
Great service
I am very pleased with the delivery and the cusromer service!
"Mateusz is nice person which help me a lot and load off my mind. Unlike another CS staff Anesha, didn't provide any help to my issue and close the chat room without asking, extreme rude."
Very difficult experience with trying to find out the status of my package - spoke with 2 different people 1 on messenger and 1 on twitter - both asked for different things to find my order. Did not get timely responses on messenger from ‘Amy’ and had some issues with Hermes contacting me through text an email. Initially told parcel with 13 clothing items had been delivered through my letter box (no chance) and then delivery updates did not update & got a text with a window of time for delivery and it was an hour and a half late of that.
Ty. Very fast
"First my order was delivered later than expected. I could not pick it up on time because I was abroad (i needed the order to go on vacation but it was delayed so I couldn't get ...), so it was sent back to you (fine, anyway I wasn't planning on keeping it). And now, I have been waiting for more than a month to be reimbursed but my parcel is still at the warehouse and God knows why, no one pick it up so that I can have my money back !! (the parcel has been there for more than a month). This is a desastrous first experience and it will be my last ! Didn't expect this from Asos and didn't know it was possible to have such deplorable customer experience ..."
Answered my questions quickly and helped straight away.
"So bad, it hurts. I ordered shoes, and received an item that was different to the picture of what I ordered. Customer services were reluctant to admit they had made a mistake and informed me asos do not allow for complaints to be made. So I had no choice but to follow the standard returns process. I asked for an item exchange as I want the shoes and returned the wrong item on 19/11/2019. I heard nothing for weeks so asked customer services what is going on, to then be told my return had been lost in transit. The support agent apologised and booked an order to be sent out next day, and to look out for an email confirming this. I receive the email, to my shock, it says I've been refunded. Not what the agent said and not what I wanted. Though I'm not surprised, they made so many mistakes."
"suberb custmer service, fast and very heplful!"
I enquired about a refund for a parcel and Georgia was nothing but helpful in providing all the information i needed and in a very prompt manner
My order was never send to me!! Very disappointed about your service!! I lost my money!!I was my first and my last order on ASOS….....…..................................
"Booked a courier to pick up a return and they did not show up despite waiting in for a 12 hour collection window. After waiting 30 minutes on the live chat, the customer service adviser said no collection was attempted and with no apology said I should try another collection method and sent a link to Hermes website. Day wasted. Will not order with Asos in future."
I love ASOS for their vast options with ranging prices. Unfortunately I’ve noticed a lot of negative inconsistencies with their promised delivery dates for both their express & standard shipping over the last few months (prior) to the holiday season.
"This interaction was really fast. Mihalea had access to all the information needed to help me. I was able to easily send a photo, which I think helped the process. Really quick and easy"
"I contacted Asus during the stressful period of the holidays, they replied to me in no time, answered all my questions and advocated to improve the service to greener and higher quality environment."
Helped with all my needs
Francesca was friendly and efficient!
Impossible to get hold of. Two orders lost and I have been charged for them with no chance of refund due to a multitude of failures on ASOS part. Breaking the consumer rights act tenfold. Unacceptable and a student £160 out of pocket.
"Extremely helpful, very quick to spot and resolve the error and re-order my lost items."
Dwayne was very helpful in a stressful moment!
"Amazing choice of items! Love their sales. I cant fault their delivery and returns. Trying to get a problem sorted can be a little long winded, being passed to a specialist team with no time scales. Been using for years and only ever had 2 problems though that got sorted."
"Harry was really helpful, a real credit to asos"
I wish I could put less than 1 star! Things take too long to recieve then if you need to return takes 45+ days for a refund leaving you emailing randomly for a hope of a reasonable response! Also they dont advise you of the custom fees you will incur and leave you with almost 10% extra in fees to pay to clear your items. For a large order like mine it worked out to be a few hundred pounds I wasn't expecting! Worst experience ever. Still chasing my refund!
"Joanna was so helpful, resolved my query quickly and efficiently. She definitely needs a bonus so Asos sort her out please."
Finally got to speak to Christopher who sorted the problem in 2 mins
"Great customer service, very accurate & fast answers and i got the help I needed!"
"I’m not sure if i should be reviewing asos in general or my customer service experience. I love asos and have been a customer for quite some time now. The experience with the chat was okay, I’m just disappointed that they were not able to give me any information regarding my refund that is very late. Otherwise, Michaela was very friendly and did her job well. Thanks."
"I had a bit of a hard time getting a replacement for a faulty item (went through 3 people) and finally got Mateusz who sorted it within minutes! Most of the time ASOS are great but they do have their moments like everyone that they let you down, but all is resolved now so i'm happy."
Good customer service
"Parcel not received. Tried to contact Courier, generic responses and dieected back to Asos. Spent half an hour on line only to be told may get replacement or refund. Can't check stock, no timescales, can't contact anyone in person. Useless compared to Amazon Customer Care/ contact"
Was talking to Nisha on Live Chat as I was getting concerned about my delivery.She responded quickly after looming into it for me. I’m now less stressing about it..
"ASOS products are superb.Been an ASOS customer for about 4 to 5 years now.Unfortunately, lately getting shipping problems."
The girl was clearly understandable. Helped to solve my problem.
they are very sweet and really want to help you
Bethany was super awesome and helpful throughout the process guiding me throughout my payment issues! Awesome support team and will come back for sure :)
"Elliott was fantastic! Elliott went above and beyond to assist me with my delivery issues and not only did he do that, he has ordered a replacement pair to be sent to me! I could not be any more thankful, Elliott was a life saver! Also very kind and polite."
"Customer service was great, quick and easy to chat to. Thank you."
Elliot was so helpful and friendly
great customer service
Issue was resolved quickly!
Thanks to Luke for checking my missing gifts problem. I think that the main issue lies with Hermes. Luke was v helpful
Daniel was helpful and resolved my query quickly.On the other hand the disjointed email updates and feedback from the courier doesn’t match up which created the confusion in the first place.
I haven’t received my refund for a return I sent. May was very polite and helpful and sorted this for me within 5 mins
Daniela was so nice and helpful
"The shipment was supposed to arrive on Nov 22nd. It's Dec 5th and I finally got a helpful representative(MIHAELA) I'd contacted the chat, email or facebook messenger at least 5x the previous two weeks and received no helpful information other than please wait. I will not use ASOS again."
"Very helpful, quick and straight to the point."
Bethany was excellent at customer service and handling the replacement of my missing item from the order. Thank you Bethany for your very professional service.
quick answer and helpful
"This company seemed to be nice when I just started ordering things there, but last half of a year is just terrible. I think it is a miracle if I don’t have to contact support about an order. Almost every time my purchase can’t be delivered in time or I have to write tons of emails to get money back...I don’t know what happened with this company but it disappoints me every time more and more. Usually it is pointless to talk with support. But last time I was talking to Elliot who was really helpful"
"Perfect, but the only thing that disappointed me is that it i return a faulty item after the 28 days that asos can give a refund than a voucher and the item broke 2-3 weeks after i received because that’s when i wore it for the first time"
Very disappointed with ASOS’s lack of flexibility on delivery and cancellations.Will not be shopping with ASOS again.
Georgia was efficient/helpful & took care of me in a breeze! Thanks for hiring intelligent people ASOS!
Good responable..
I had messaged ASOS help on Twitter about not being able to know what my email was and they told me so I was able to access my account thanks!
"The costumer services is super good and nice, but the delivery is probably the worst... it takes way too much time, and I didn’t got my package more than one time, and many times the orders are running late.... I really think you should work with other delivery company...."
My four stars are for Conner and only Conner. He's an OG customer service rep. It's so hard to find a decent customer service rep but he made my bad experience positive.
"Everything went well, questions were answered quickly"
Great customer service. Got helped with spotting my order and arranging it to come my way! Very helpful and fast!
"really easy to resolve a query with, polite and responsive.  Couldn't ask for more. :-)"
"Connor was lovely, so helpful."
Ive been a customer with asos for years and recently Fedex lost my package and I talked to asos and they were able to get me a replacement. Thank you! especially to Jerrilee who was so kind and quick with the service.
"Amazing clothes, great delivery (usually, unless it's Black Friday) but jesus christ they have the WORST customer service known to man. On Twitter they don't read a word you're saying and use standard copy and paste replies which drive you INSANE. I'd stop shopping with them due to their terrible customer service if they didn't cater to plus size so well."
i have ordered an item and ASOS workers said we can not provide the tracking number this is the first time i see shipment without tracking!!
"I ordered the ASOS edition sequin kimono sleeve wedding dress in a size 0 (which was a tad loose in the shoulders and hips) and let me just say how beautiful it was! The dress is absolutely fabulous! Very elegant and First Lady like...  I received compliments the entire evening. The dress was purchased so I could wear it to my run clubs annual gala extravaganza, which was 11-30-19. From the moment I walked in, heads were turned, and mouths were agape. If you are considering purchasing this dress, don’t hesitate! If you desire to stand out amongst everyone then this is the perfect dress for you! It’s authentic, classy, chic, elegant, Royal, with a hint of sexiness! You’ll be the talk of your event for days to come!"
"My order was missing an item, which is very frustrating.I spoke with Narina over the chat to discuss the situation. She was very friendly and incredibly helpful. Couldn't ask for any better customer service"
"i had a great experience, stress free"
"The worst customer service I have experienced! My original parcel “Delivered” when in fact it was stolen and had my signature forged, then when contacted took over 3 days to get through to someone and a replacement order sorted which certain items were sold out.When the replacement order was despatched I requested to be sent to my neighbours as I wasn’t home and that also went missing. Now this order has now been “delivered” to whom I have no idea. Asos refuse to compensate me or even give me my money back and tbh it’s taken almost a week for basically nothing to happen and conversation with generic answers from ASOS.  That’s way too much time of mine used with no resolution so I’ve given up and ASOS can keep their items and my money and I will NEVER shop with asos again!"
Very bad experience I received from ASOS  where you pay for express shipping you don’t get order On the delivery date they give you .. I needed the dress very urgent that was why I paid for express shipping you guys are full of disappointments always
"My agent, Jerrilee, was patient, knowledgeable, and caring. I appreciate the great service!"
"Emma was very helpful, prompt with her response and assisted with mu inquiry."
Very good customer service!
Super helpful and kind! Very patient and understanding of my queries.
Quick and exactly feedback.
Lianne gave great customer service and helped me resolve my problem without any complications. The customer service was great and very professional.
Abbas was great and very helpful. Resolved my issues without any problems.
"Customer Service is not their Piority, spent so much hours searching n buying only to have packed half your items n indicate All. Always missing an item 😡😡😡"
clarassa was very helpful with explaining the return process and assisting me with the return of a faulty item
"had a bit if trouble with delivery but they were great, offered to replace/refund my order within the next day."
Great and quick customer service
clarassa was the most helpful out of all the people I spoke to.
"Selina was amazingly helpful!!! I've been very lucky with all the customer service that I've ever needed from Asos when something did, unfortunately, go awry."
Missing items from order.  Open up an online chat and sorted within 15 minutes.  Now waiting receipt of replacement goods.
"Nothing short of poor, can’t get hold of anyone. Sat on the live chat for hours and no one still came. Twitter response is just as horrific to be very honest, if they can’t handle the Black Friday sales there is no point of having them!! Trying to cancel an order that hasn’t even shipped but they won’t allow me, would rather me wait a week to receive it only to return it back. Won’t be shopping with them again!! Shop at your own risk"
Understanding and very helpful 😊
Oliver was exceptional.  He was helpful and patient.  He listened and took the time to research my issue in a timely manner.
Hermes did not deliver my order despite saying I had signed for it when I wasn't even in. But ASOS CS team were very helpful and arranged a replacement order CS rep 24286503 was great
As per usual ASOS customer service was completely rubbish. Emailed and received no reply went though chat process twice then got a patronising bit of extra advice togo along with the very basic answer I needed to save us all some effort.
Lesley was excellent. Had a really difficult time before but she solved all the issues! She was lighthearted yet professional. Asos need more Lesleys to solve their issues!
Able to help me quick and easy. Give me the right amount of information and tell me specifically what was the problem with my order. Was also able to tell me when I should receive my order.
"Very kind, was very on point when it came to explaining something to me. That’s highly important to me, knowing that I’m not there in person."
Worst customer service! Over 2 days and no reply to query relating to delivery via facebook! Even offered to pay additional and have not got a reply! Have since emailed however no reply even though I immediately replied to their response!
"Great customer service, polite, efficient and dealt with my query promptly."
Good quick response from customer service
"I would prefer if it was on a private chat on asos website, and not on facebook or any other social media app."
Very quick reply narnia was very thorough and knowledgeable
"There is too many good ways to contact with them. I can't find phone number and chat button, I don't want to wait for email reply. So I just try to connect on Messenger. It was worked very well and they respond very quick. Instructions are very clear and easy. My problems solved, it gets just 15 minutes."
Helpful and honest - quick to reply.
Mabz was very fast and practical thank you for your service
Amazing costumer service
excellent customer service from Suzanne
Oliver was very helpful and patient he handled my query with complete professionalism
"Their range has got better over the past few years, however, there's a lot of repetition, especially in the jeans department! The ASOS support team is super friendly should anything go amiss with returns or delivery."
Very helpful and quick to sort issue
"Received a faulty jacket and was reassured I could get a replacement, I indicated on the return slip that I would like an exchange although Asos decided to refund me instead, even though the jacket is still in stock in the size that was ordered. As this order was put through with a one off discount code I’m no longer able to get the item at the price I purchased it. Asos are now telling me that I have to contact unidays for a code even though the fault lies on their part. I’m extremely disappointed as I have used Asos for years and always been happy with my purchases but this has really put me off returning."
"Very helpful! Despite my impatience, first reply all day, thanks again!"
the help chat was very helpful
This is absolute failure and disgusting i have 3 orders and none of them has arrived not even any updates one of the orders suppose to be delivered last week even and im still waiting and asos team r just totally ignoring have emailed them txt them on fb messenger have tried asos life chat its just useless ....i mean what a EMBARRASSMENT TO WHOLE WORLD people r out there literally begging inc.me to respond and resolve it....now at this point i just done care i want my refund and basically thank u very much for all the products ill better buy in any other clothing brand who doesn't failed even on this such a busy BLACK FRIDAY.....IM SORRY ASOS I MEAN UVE GOT TO IMPROVE MASSIVELY.....AT LAST IM DEMANDING TO REFUND MY 💷BACK AND WISH U A GOOD LUCK
The best customer service every time!!
Great service
The chat was quick and helpful
I would absolutely recommend buying from ASOS! I live in NZ and my order came sooner than I expected! The clothes I ordered are amazing and quality is 💯🔥
"Lost my items, refused to resend them, wouldn't give me the same discount I got when I ordered them"
i recieved exactly what i wanted for a great price. not expensive. delivery was slower than some others but was not in rush to recieve. thank you.
Linzi on live chat was the most helpful. Thank you
"I heard so much about this Asos, that I had to try, and when I was looking for a dress for Xmas party I ordered it in late October to be ready for end of November... Well, Asos then cancel the order and tells me they are out of stock, so I then set notification options... Dress back to stock. I ordered again.. And this time after 7 days from shipment I decided to search for help. Turns out dress is lost.. Great, left me with 3days to find new outfit.I'm pretty new and bought few items but I don't know sizing or quality from pictures, I return few items. Then Asos decides to tell me that my account is now flagged for high returns volume... Seriously?!  What a poor experience. I will think twice before I order again."
I pay for premier delivery so I can have my order the next day or on a day I know I’ll be home. This is why I pay for it. Yet ASOS during busy periods can just switch it off and make me wait up to 10 days for my order. When they switch it back on they then can not expedite my order even though I could order it again today and receive it tomorrow. Zero customer service and clearly premier delivery is a rip off. ASOS = ZERO customer service
"Placed a order through Asos and I pay for the years premium service and selected next day delivery, couple of days pass and no parcel to be seen, check the tracking and Hermes have lost the parcel. Not ASOS’s fault in the slightest, however trying to get intouch with Asos is ridiculous, have tried their Facebook, live chat, twitter and now emailed them, no answer to any. And still no parcel because Hermes are a joke"
Waited a little while for a response even though I had hoped it could have been dealt with straight away. But once someone got in touch in response to my messages they were very helpful and resolved it quickly and to my satisfaction. Thanks!
so kindlythank u so much
"Safina was the best! Safina was very thorough and patient with me. I had a bad experience with ASOS customer service before, which made me a bit apprehensive to try to chat with you all again, but I was able to get what I asked for because of Safina's help. Thanks Safina!"
Adil was extremely helpful and efficiently solved my issue. One of the better customer service experiences I have had. 5 stars!
Rhiannon was helpfully and was very speedy in helping resolve the issue and gave choices on how we could resolve it
"Arnie was very reassuring and even sympathized for the struggle I had with the shop who scanned through my parcel under a different delivery company then I selected. Thanks for your help Arnie and in your famous words... I'll be back! Haha sorry, couldn't resist!"
The agent was helpful once you get through but the waiting time to get through to a customer service representative is an absolute joke - I was stuck in the queue for at least 40 minutes before getting through to someone and this happened two days in a row.
Joseph was very helpful in assisting me with my issue in returning my parcel in HK.
"I will never use Asos again. They canceled my black Friday order without telling me anything. I discovered it days later because I wanted to track my package and I contacted them by chat. The customer service just replied that “it can happen”. No excuse, no goodwill gesture, no nothing. Now of course all the item that I ordered on the Black Friday are out of stock or at a much more expensive price... SUCH A SHAME Don’t trust them, they have NO customer service at all, so if they do something wrong, too bad for you! SHAME SHAME SHAME"
Apparently my account is under watch due to returning some clothes that either didn't fit or didn't suit me - ASOS do you expect us to just keep things that doesn't work for us? Just to line your pockets? I really don't see how that works.Forget 'fit assistant' and 'style match' - I want to try on the clothes myself not through some virtual world which is unrealistic.Ridiculous.
"After my package went missing I contacted ASOS for assistance, like FedEx requested me to do. ASOS told me to wait two week to see if it showed up, nothing came. Contacted them again told me to wait another week, still nothing came. Contacted them a third time told me to wait another week. At this point it seemed a bit ridiculous that I had to wait over a month to get an actual resolution to the problem. I asked for them the send me a replacement order, that they said they would overnight. The package did not get it overnighted. Instead just got the run around by customer service, with them having to confirm my address multiple different times with multiple different people. In the end I did not end up getting my order because they ran out of stock of EVERY item I purchased. If they just would have resolved the problem it earlier they would have kept a long time customer."
"Anita on the Customer Chat tool was extremely helpful when dealing with a stressful situation regarding ASOS taking 2 payments from my account when I only placed 1 order. She didn't brush the issue off as my fault and looked into things properly and took the appropriate action. I would have given 5 stars if the issue could have been sorted straight away, but this is not the fault of the staff, probably more a process within the company. Thanks Anita! ⭐️"
5 star for my side......
Rhiannon was very helpful and quick to respond
Thanks for support!
Lauren was superb and got things sorted immediately. Top employee. Give her Christmas Day off! Lol
Very kind and helpful
"Great customer service, great clothes. Don't really shop any where else."
Prompt and helpful reply from online agents!
I am disappointed because it happend for the first time that my order was not proceeded and I lost my discount. The ASOS company did not compensate for that in any way.
The member of your team Mihaela was very kind to me in chatting about my problem. She gave me clear and express answers and it was please chatting with her! She is an excellent member of your team. Regards from Croatia and sorry for the mistakes of my English!
Fantastic customer service. Quick and informative feedback :)
I ordered an item on the 29/11/12 and paid for next day delivery. After noticing I ordered the wrong the size immediately after ordering. I went on the live chat to amend the order. After waiting for 20 minutes to connect to an agent (Yasmin Tribak). I was told that nothing could be done as it was 5 minutes over the 15 minutes you have to amend an order.
They immediatly helped me and forwarded my problem to the right people who could help me.
"I am extremely disappointed with the service from this company and would highly recommend anyone using this site to think twice about shopping with them !I live in the uk, I have placed 4 orders in total and only 1 of those arrived as paid for as for the other 3 first was placed as a single order though I only recieved 1 of the 4 garments ordered as a single order. When I contacted the company through their online chat I waited almost half hour before connecting with anyone and was informed they had no idea why this happened but they did request those items to be re ordering and sent so at least they did sort this out quickly!Then I placed another order 2 weeks later, buying 3 items though ordered 2 separately but both within 10 mins of each other paying for next day, this was on a Friday.On the Saturday  ( next day ) I only recieved the first order and the second one with the 2 items didn't arrive, made contact again waiting a long time before getting through and was told I'd have to wait till Monday, in Monday still nothing waited again to get through on their online chat and was informed I had to wait till Tuesday, Tues came and still nothing, again waited to connect and was informed it could now be passed to their specialist team to investigate. I received one email to inform me the specialist tem now had my query and would get back to me shortly but if I had anymore questions or concerns this person would be happy to help, that was Tuesday morning, now Wednesday and I've still heard Nothing, I sent an email to the person saying he would be happy to help and he hasn't responded, I've gone back to the site to use the online chat only to find this is no longer an option  !My order comes to the value of £154 and yet they have done absolutely Nothing to resolve it. I can't speak to anyone and they continue to advertise these items for sale so I don't understand why I am having such issues !I would seriously suggest that anyone thinking of buying from Asos look elsewhere  !"
"Do not order if you live in Canada! Worst customer service. On top of the item amount you have to pay customs. If it doesn’t fit, you have to PAY to return. All of that money is not refunded. The customer service rep I chatted with was terrible. Thanks Jasmin. You suck. I’m am so dissatisfied. The product wasn’t what I expected either. Ran super large. I tried to find reviews on their website without any luck. Most likely they wouldn’t have many great reviews!  Disappointed."
I have been dealing with Francesca and she's been very helpful and efficient.
Great customer service
Love Asos. Always do what they say and great for presents.
"I was in touch with Asos to find out why my tracking number was not showing any info and the woman I talked on the day before simply told me to wait a few days. I contacted again and spoke with Michael, who was really sweet and figured out everything for me. He was really helpful!"
"We bought a black north face jacket on Saturday at a good id price for my daughter for Christmas. This was her one wish to get a north face jacket. To my disappointment, even though the money was taken straight away and all seemed to be perfect.. I received an email aday later to say unfortunately they cant sell me the jacket for security reasons.I have never experienced anything like this before, i persumed once the item was paid for the item was yours. My daughter is now distraught.This is a Terrible service. Iwill never buy from this company again or will any of my friends and family."
Very polite and extremely helpful in resolving my issue
I spoke with Navpreet on Live Chat with a returns query. Although it took a while to get through to anyone to speak to (25 mins) - Navpreet was really helpful and answered all my questions within minutes. My query is now resolved and I'm happy with the service received
"Olivia was quick, helpful and friendly! Thank you so much!"
"Lauren was very understanding, thorough and helpful!! She was great!!"
Kris was very helpful and rectified my issue
Really helpful and efficient!
Delayed order delivery by 7 days without telling me. Spent over £100 on the order and had to email them to find out if anything can be sorted. They didn't actually read my email just sent a standard response. I reached out on Twitter and the same thing happened. Overall really poor service.
Great help and sorted the issue quickly.
"Delivery estimation say it will take 11 days to come, when I enquired about this the help was no use whatsoever"
Good service really !!
Luke was very helpful and patient with me and provided a solution for my problem!
I was very happy with Jamie's support.
Danielle was really helpful today sorting out my order of refund.
"Delivery is terribly slow:  10 days!  What a joke.  I queried the wait on the 'chat line' to see if I could upgrade my delivery.   'Too late', they told me and what about cancelling I asked 'Too late' they told me again and 'rules are rules'.  This morning, several days later,  I checked the status of my order and they still haven't sent it.  Come on!  My daughters and I will be shopping elsewhere from now on."
i had a great experience with christine! really i had no idea that she will be that nice to chat with!! she deserves 10 stars not only 5!
solved my issue quickly and efficiently.
"Luke was very helpful, and went out of his way to assist me. The issue was resolved within two minutes."
I have been speaking today with Napreet from Asos customer service and he was very helpful and polite. he managed to solve my problem very fast.
Graeme helped me great with my queries. The chat closed on early but he found another way to contact me to resolve my issue.
Had a nightmare trying to get hold of Hermes regarding a parcel that had been delivered to a random address. ASOS chat was SO helpful and offered to either refund or resend the lost items straight away.
"IF I COULD GIVE ASOS ZERO STARS I would. If you are ordering from asos, forget about customer service. I’ve been ordering from them for years now and they could simply careless about their customers. I’ve had two incidents with ASOS. The first time I thought was just bad luck but after this time , I will never shop on ASOS again or recommend it to anyone. First experience involved me sending it to another address that was not convenient to me, I notified ASOS and they said it was too late so I go and pick it up from the address and low and behold IT WAS NOT THERE. I told ASOS someone took my package , but instead of offering me a replacement package, they told me I need to notify the police. And what about the money I spent ASOS? Nope they don’t care. Second incident is that they send me an item that’s faulty and they sent the wrong size. When I asked them for some sort of compensation, Tara kept insisting that I return the package. The item is out of stock so returning the package means I would lose the item. I liked the shoes and would have been okay keeping them if I wasn’t paying full price for them. I tried to explain that to her and she stated the only way I could get my money back is by returning the item. I then asked to speak to a manager to which she stated she “couldn’t do” because they have protocols they need to handle and then rudely ended the chat on me . Even shein refunded me when their item was faulty . Waste of money. I rather just buy the items from the companies themselves than support an industry with no customer service."
Sophie was so nice.
Clear and fast explanation
"Sadly incredibly poor service from ASOS and still no resolution. I renewed and paid for my ASOS Premier on 11th Nov but it hasn’t seemed to register on the site so when I went to place an order with the Black Friday discounts it refused to offer me free Premier Delivery and wanted to charge me £5.95 for next day delivery. Despite chasing ASOS repeatedly to question what happened, everything was selling out. After having their iT team look into it, it started working yesterday - Tuesday. When everything I wanted was out of stock. How very convenient. I am now incredibly disappointed to see you’ve started charging me from the day I ordered it despite not being able to use it. I asked for the start date to be amended to yesterday and not the 11th Nov as it’s an error with the company that I haven’t been able to do so. I was told they couldn’t do this for ‘legal and security reasons’ which doesn’t make any sense. I am fuming and will be taking this further."
My parcel was delivered to the wrong address (all my fault) but the kind Tara with customer service help me get a replacement...great work Tara!
"I contacted live chat as I had a missing parcel, April was very efficient and helped with my issue, couldn't have asked for more"
Great customer service provided by Oliver. Thanks!
Fast replay and very helpful!
Lauren was very nice and polite and took quick actions to help me. Very appreciated.
I recently placed an order as a birthday gift which never arrived. The person I queried it with on the Asos online chat was extremely unhelpful and didn’t seem to care at all. I decided to place a different order and paid for a next day delivery service. This was 4 days ago and I’m still waiting......trying to get help from the online ‘chat now’ is ridiculous as you just wait and wait to be connected.It’s all just an all round poor service.
Connor helped smooth thing over to the best of his ability. Oliver was rude and curt and could really use so customer service training. issue is not resolved but policy is policy. Nothing that can be done about receiving a BROKEN item. Can only return and not receive a replacement.
Great and quick help!
It’s like talking to a robot
"Sabrina was very helpful , efficient and patient.  Thank you for excellent customer service :-) , Kind regards,  Santina"
"Kind , understanding, helpful, anything you would expect and more! Thank you."
Brilliant service and very kind !
Oliver was very helpful with my order issue.  He sent out a replacement jacket and was very accommodating.  Thank U Oliver.
"There was a problem with my order leaving the warehouse, however, customer service promptly solved the problem and reissued my order."
"Although my problem isn’t resolved yet, Daniel was committed to helping me throughout our conversation. Will hope to hear my good news tomorrow."
Nice guy.  Helpful.
You are just perfect. You solved my problem like I was in the store to speak with you directly. Thanks so much and God bless
"I had an issue with an order not going through and when I contacted the chat support, the person didn't seem sympathetic to my situation at all and didn't have any sense of urgency in helping me get the issue resolved.It's like they had an ""I don't care if I have your business or not"" attitude."
Thank you Mabz
Oliver was a delight to work with and so easy and friendly. Very good at his job!!!
I got lot of help
James has been excellent with his service. He provided clear and helpful information.
"Sarah was prompt, polite and was very quick at resolving my query. Great asset to the business!"
"I order the dresses for over a month but I still haven't receive them yet. I was given a reference number and was told by the agent with the reference number and my address, I can contact my local post office to track the package. However the agent then said the order is untraceable. With common knowledge, a post office needs a tracking number in order to track a package, the reference number in my order is not the information which my local office can use. I'm very frustrate right now as I need the dresses for Christmas and I'm so worried that it won't be delivered on time."
"I was very distressed and upset that my package had been stolen, Suzanne helped me by leading me through questions to check if my package was really stolen and put in for a replacement of my package. I am so satisfied with her customer service, and I am so grateful for ASOS for being so understanding."
My chat helper was great.  No issues at all.
Selina was great help! 1st time customer and I am pleased with the customer service. Although the shoes did not fit. LOL
Fast and knowledgeable!
Very understanding and was able to provide a couple of solutions to rectify the issue.
Suzanne was kind and helpful
They do a great job of refunding you if overnight shipping doesn’t come in time or if there are shipping issues
"Been trying to contact through the social media channels forever as I had been sent a wrong item. Ended up coming to the live chat and got through instantly (probably because it was nearly 1:30am 🤣) however, was spoken to by a lowvely gentleman named Ben thay got straight to the point and passed the issue on to relevant channels! Very speedy and quick but also saved me waiting forever for a response through Twitter DM."
Oliver was extremely helpful in getting my replacement orders process since UPS delivered my orders to the wrong address.
Asos as a company are fantastic. Asos  orders that get delivered via Dpd are fantastic.  Asos orders that get despatched into the care of Hermes are s.h.i.t.  Hermes are pointless. Hermes drivers ( to my address ) are blatant liars. They either say they've tried to deliver then return my order back to Asos having not bothered trying to deliver. The absolute classic one.. parcel delivered to my porch.. I LIVE IN A BLOCK OF FLATS!! Priceless!
Thank for your help. Hope to solve the problem quickly.
Hannah was so helpful. I didn't have to wait too long and she was polite!
Narina was great!
Dreadful customer service
Jamal was very helpful and insightful and he responded quickly.
"ASOS has been my favorite company for years due to free fast shipping, easy returns, great product, and great service. Recent changes to United States operations have been abysmal, unfortunately, and I would no longer recommend supporting the company in the US due to the following reasons:1) USPS shipping was suddenly and secretly removed for returns. Customers could choose between UPS and the convenience of a USPS home pickup. Suddenly, only UPS is available. When talking to customer service, I was told to walk 30 minutes to a UPS drop-off location with my return.2) Orders arrive by inconsistent carriers and are frequently delayed.3) The ""What's new"" assortment is no longer relevant for US shoppers. It is a mess of random product and not the assortment that UK users see.4) Quality of product has declined. I don't know who is responsible for operations in Georgia, but it has been messy and disappointing. I'm hoping to give ASOS another chance given their amazing extended sizing, but they will no longer be my go-to fashion destination and I worry for their future as a company. I wholeheartedly recommend ASOS for customers in the UK, but the US experience is disappointing."
Very nice customer service! Highly recommend
Harry was super helpful! He made the process quick and easy. Thank you for your help.
So helpful and really easy! Resolved my issue in minutes! :)
"Zahid, the person who helped me was quick, and very helpful!"
Delivery issue was sorted out quickly by Shohaib. Thanks for the help!
Quickly resolved my issue. Thanks!
quick and easy responses
great. Problem was solved
Jack was helpful during our chat today.. He made sure I got what I needed.. Great Customer service.. Thank You Jack!!
"I used the online chat feature to speak to customer services about a returns issue, and the consultant, Janine, was very helpful. She was fast, efficient and helped me with my issue. We were able to get the issue sorted. Very impressed with the service"
"Fazari was rude throughout, showed no understanding of my problem and was a long way short of helpful. Very disappointed with ASOS on this occasion, and will not be shopping with them again."
Marta was really helpful thank you.
AMAZING !!!! Selina was the only member of this team to help sort my lost order out after trying for over a week and listening to more than 3 people. She helped me out straight away and now I am moving forward to getting a refund. I can't thank her for her enough.
My black Friday experience ruined!!I for one will definitely reconsider ordering with ASOS again.The website duplicated my order. I went VIA the live chat to cancel one once I realized I had been charged twice to be told it is past 60 minutes and I had to return the item back in my own time. This is a massive inconvenience and very unfair. I am well within my consumer rights to cancel an order within 14 days. ASOS deny customers this right through their process. Customer service is very poor and when you ask to speak with a manger they deny this with automated messages
I like your clothes but your stupid euro currency got me messed up spending so much more than i thought. I also don’t like you using fedex PLEASE stick to UPS
Quick to help sent options and was polite
Hannah was helpful and even referred to a specialist team to help with my matter.
Advisor was very helpful thankyou.
"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Their refund process and customer service is so terrible, I’d rather pay more elsewhere than shop with them. Honestly, it’s not worth it."
"Very shocking how a big company deals with customers, to be told that there is nothing they can do with my order been delayed when I paid for premier delivery and couldn't use it until after placing the order. Very disappointing how I as a customer spend money every month shopping at this company and when it comes to a simple problem that should be handled with care. I get told nothing they can do when other companies around are dealing with same stress and are not treating faithful customers this way. Totally unfair"
Waiting for more than one month for refund after I got the wrong product type (And returned it).The customer service in Facebook messenger reply in a delay of at least one day without even looking at the last messages written in the same conversation.Worst service I’ve got ever !
"Order lots from the site an never had any problems . Had to use online chat today to confirm a return , took a while to get a reply but its a busy time of year , got am problem resolved in no time .. ideal ."
Courtney was a great help in regards to my asos return enquiry
Paid for premium delivery - £9.95 for a years worth of next day delivery. 9/10 they do not deliver next day. I also raised this issue for a refund of the £9.95 as they don’t give you what you have paid for. Asos clothes are good but there delivery service is not. Plenty of other online clothing companies that are way better.In my opinion - shop elsewhere!
Amy was very understanding and helpful
"I do love shopping on ASOS and I do very frequently! Although my experiences during my last few orders have been very shocking for an establishment that I spend soo much money at. I placed a few orders and haven't received them, I've contacted customers services to be 1- ignored on live chat, 2- been given false information and 3- not being kept in the loop about order issues and or delays. Although today I was kindly greeted by the lovely Lauren who was very attentive, helpful and friendly. Soo many the Lauren in customer services who answered my questions and but my mind at ease. Unlike Arnie who ended my live chat before it had even begun (for reference these was chat ref 24151845)."
"Christine was super helpful and resolved my issue immediately. Due to her customer care, she's kept my relationship with ASOS intact, and i'll be happy to shop there again."
"Really disappointed with ASOS. I have been a loyal customer and made an order last week. After wondering why my order had not been dispatched, I tried logging into my account only to find it had been blocked (no notification or email sent to inform me of this). I have been back and forth with customer service emails and still NOTHING has happened and my account is still blocked. I understand and appreciate security, but there is no excuse to take my money, block my account and not dispatch my order on time."
ASOS customer care are always very good and solve problems as quickely as possible
Quick and painless replacement! Thank you Asos :)
"Michael was really helpful and polite. It will be perfect if the order finally arrives, as it was supposed to be delivered last week and no delay was informed"
"Terrible service, pay £9.99 a year for next day delivery which they can’t do, after a few days of complaining and get very vague responses they cancelled my order and just refunded me, when they do message me back they can’t even get my name right, asked on many occasions to speak with a manager which is constantly ignored, nothing offered in way of apology for parcels missing and very late deliveries"
Francesca is a BABEshe totally got my issue and empathised with me. Best advisor I have ever had on ASOS
"Vlad, top Lad. Thank you for your help today in my quest to finding my lost parcels. have the best christmas dear sir."
thanks Luke for quick help.
Connor was very quick at helping me today with my returns and provided me with the information i required!
Amazing service:)
"Quick to respond, really helpful and sorted my issue pretty much immediately. Very polite and answered all my questions. Thank you!"
"very quick and efficient response, honoured a previous reduced price as they had incorrectly refunded me instead of an exchange."
"Although I had to wait 30 minutes for someone to talk to me, Christine was very good and told me ""how it was"" with my order."
Won't ever be using ASOS again. They've clearly been making cuts to improve their profit margins and it's showing with their customer experience. They've failed to deliver an order that should have arrived 5 days ago and their customer service team are impossible to get a response from (other than the copy and paste first-response message. AVOID.
"Using online Chat - it took a while for anyone to answer my chat call, I almost gave up thinking it had frozen and no one would answer. However, I left this running whilst I got on with some other bits and then someone responded almost an hour after I first opened the chat. Tamara was really helpful in dealing with my concerns and resolved the issues efficiently. Thank you"
"I have been using ASOS for the past 6 years and I'm sad to say that their customer service has gone downhill. I placed 4 orders in the last 4 months. In my first order, I had received two of the same t-shirts and the wrong shoe size. I never received two of my orders because they lost my parcel along the way and I had to find out through their live chat. In my last order, they sent me the wrong pair of trousers and the wrong belt. In summary, every time I place an order, there's bound to be a mistake. Very disappointed!"
very helpful live chat service
Excellent customer service!
Lauren was great
they were unreliable and not organised
"Great customer care, super nice people, always friendly and willing to explain everything. Thank you for your patience :)"
Amber was very kind and patient trying to help me find a particular dress
"had some questions on my order and used the chat, Mihaela was very helpful and quick to answer, thank you"
Customer friendly !!
"Placed an order, didn't notify me that it will take up to 11-days to deliver. Once I checked told me est. date, was too far off so I wanted to cancel order. Wouldn't let me cancel. Ridiculous company, will never purchase from again."
"April was a pleasure to work with! She was fast, polite and a real asset to ASOS. Will continue to shop with ASOS, especially knowing the team behind them has staff like her!"
"ASOS customer service, as always, is excellent! Such lovely people."
Patient and helpful
"Professionally and quickly answered my question, I am satisfied !!!"
May was really helpful and has great communication.
Exceptional customer service.
Brilliant customer service from a gentleman named Ethan. Sorted out my problem instantly.
Amazing service!!!! Continue the good work! It really helps that you guys talk to your customers and my favourite part is you actually ask people how their day is. Some of us might be going through some things and you really make our day feel better! Lovely customer service!
"Amazing Becky was outstanding, she helped with my query and was polite and listened very well, I was on with Owen before who was lazy, made me repeat things as he was telling me to do certain things multiple times that I had already done, Becky is trying to fix a problem I had with delivery, Owen told me he could do nothing even though I contacted DPD and they said he just needed to contact them to fix the problem, he said he could but basically because it was the wrong address and not a spelling mistake he won't contact them, but as I say Becky was outstanding"
Sorted out my issue with my return speedily and efficiently.
Mihaela was able to promptly resolve my query and provide an excellent level of customer service.
ASOS chat with Sadia was quick and helpful! Sorted in a couple of minutes
Sara was helpful and she did her best to help
Quickly resolved by Courtnay. Excellent service
"Olivia from customer service, was very understanding and helpful! It’s a shame they don’t use the best delivery courier.Thanks Olivia for a great experience and finding a solution."
Proficient help. Issue was resolved quickly and effectively
Very nice and helpful
"Had an issue with returns packaging but Kate resolved my query quickly and efficiently, whilst being very friendly."
"To be honest, I did not find this service helpful. They offered me no solution or compensation for the error and it was a bit of a waste of time."
I have been speaking to Mia this morning regarding a missing delivery and her customer service is incredible.5 STARS!
April was really helpful and gave me all the information i needed
Sara is the best !Very helpful Thanks
My query was handled in a fast and efficient manner by Emily. Thank you so much.
Very helpful thank you
Very helpful and polite
"Always amazing service - I've been waiting 2 weeks for my refund, contacted ASOS on live chat, gave them my royal mail receipt and April on live chat said they had not received the item and just issued a full refund straight away."
Neglected to mention when I made the order that the delivery time had been increased from 3-5 working days to 11 until after I made the order. Failed to promptly reply to email enquires. Fundamentally poor communication with customers.
Scott is great!
"Unable to help, asked many unnecessary questions only to refer me to another customer service team who would contact me by email. Not satisfactory."
Quickly answered my question!
Very fast and efficient service! Thank you!
Great quality and the chat if you have an issue with something is very good
Jerrilee was very helpful and help to me sort the refund of my 4 orders that were returned because of APG's faults.
The rep helped me.
"If you’re lucky enough to get your parcels delivered by DPD, ASOS provide a brilliant service that you cannot match from anywhere else, especially on there returns.Anything ordered that is delivered by Hermes, I have had nothing but problems with such as, them not delivering in the time frame, saying it’s delivered and signing it themselves and it not being delivered on that day altogether"
"Good and fast service, I was happy to give the service representative"
"Leah helped me and answered my question accordingly, she looked into the issue I was having and confirmed a question I had, she was excellent."
Lots of information and went out of their way to help me
The issue was resolved quickly and the agent was helpful
"Free Next Day Delivery for £9.99 really sells ASOS to me. Can get some bargains and prices are usually competitive. Upset they took away the rewards scheme but the service is too good to stop using. Never had any issues and I've done 40+ orders over the years (100+ items) and any problem has been solved by Facebook messenger which is fantastically effortless. I've converted many people to ASOS over the years, should have a refer a friend scheme."
I spoke to rhia today and she was so helpful! Really caring and solved my issues
Quick resolve my issue. Nice services.
"Asos has amazing customer service, I had an issue with my order and they took care of it immediately. Their live chat is available 24/7 with very responsive employees ! Thank you Charlie for your help! Very professional !"
Awsome nice chat
It was fast and easy.. sorted my problem and im happy with the customer care
Love this site. Great deals & Amazing customer service!

"Jerrome was excellent.I had a problem with a next-day delivery. It was delayed, but I asked for a refund and Jerrome was really helpful. Now i have to wait 72 hours to see if I can get it :)"
"He was helpful, kind and quick"
Craig was amazing - after someone else couldn't help me  (or thought they could - but didn't) - and I was so busy - I was getting cross.  He sorted it out beautifully. Hurrah!!
Chat:  24205655Emma was fantastic and easily resolved my issues.
"This is my second time ordering from ASOS - first time the package took a month to arrive, second time it never arrived. They only provide a dispatch number not an actual tracking #. At least the chat support are somewhat helpful. We will see if my refund comes through."
Quick response and helpful in discovering the issue.
Really helpful on the chat
Quick resolution & swift response.
i made a mistake on an order size and got in touch to change from a size 8 to a 10. i was told to cancel the order but it was outside the 15 minutes (it was 25 minutes) since i made the order and the man could not help me. very disappointing since i was quick to spot my error. would make me consider using asos again
Fast and conclusive answers.
Awesome experience
I ordered whole bunch of clothes on 11/30/19 and paid for express shippingWhen I received my clothes today I realized they made a mistake on one of the item they gave me a sweater instead of the sweatpants so I contacted them right away to tell them the order issue but the first thing they want me to do was to return their sweater. It’s holiday season I have no time to return this so I told them to refund me the difference between the sweater and the sweatpants (sweater was $20 cheaper) and they still won’t do that for me. W T H! W T F! I dont wanna spend my time on ur mistakes! I have to say they have nice selections of clothes but SUPER BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
Jonathon was very helpful and offered a replacement
Narina was very helpful and understanding of my issue with my order. Happy with this experience on the chat room help
"I love shopping with ASOS. The brands are on-trend, shipping is fast, and the customer service is superb! I'm a lifetime customer!"
Elysha helped me to resolve everything
"Despite unfortunately not receiving my order, was eventually sorted swiftly in this presumably very busy time of black friday"
Helpful and efficient online chat for refund queries
I did a live chat with Poppy and she was wonderful. Gave me all the information I needed in a quick and friendly manner.
Good customer service from Kristofer. Took a long time to get an agent though.
"Harry was really helpful when resolving my query. He was friendly, knowledgeable and made sure that my query was resolved in a timely and professional manner. Thank you Harry for your great customer service :-)"
"Horrible customer service, they don't tell you there will be huge customs charges at pick up that aren't included at checkout. can't get ahold of anyone that works there, no phone number to call, not helpful at all and would definitely never order from there again."
Quick response x
"Sean is very polite and usefull with advices, thank you for the service!"
Shopping became a breeze once they offered their premier two day free shipping few years ago; I can always rely on them as a trusted source when it comes to finding a last minute outfits for an event plus their stylish/affordable clothing.
Terrible terrible - ordered and carrier said they had my order - next email from ASOS says returned to them! I never received it - AVOID AVOID this company!
Disponibilità immediata
Helpful chat. Answered my questions.
LEITH done a wonderful job in assisting me with my help. thanks Leith
"Paul was friendly and really helpful, good job"
Deanna was really helpful!
Do not trust this company. Two items missing and they sent me to credit company they don’t want to know just want it money. Stay away
"Liberty on 02/12/19...20:00hrs . helpped me with 3 issues, she was amazing and timely.and patientTHANKYOU"
Deanna was very helpful and sorted my problem with delivery costs.
staff is always kind and knowledgable. You don't have to repeat your query over and over. They are quick to find answers and resolutions.
Dealt with Elise who was fantastic. Issue resolved in minutes. Can't fault ASOS
"Hasan was very quick and kind to answer my questions, truly a good customer service. Specially to solve problems for my international problems. For any Argentinians watching this, ship with express delivery so you can avoid dealing with customs directly. the fees will appear but it will be less of a headache"
I got all answers to my questions
Not a good service (Leigh Ann) to be honest about my missing order!This will have consequences because I have 50K followers on instagram. I have the goal to advise my followers with the service of some brands.
My package was lost. I had bought the items were there was a promo on the website. Customer Service said they would refund me my money but I had to fight to get the replacement discount. So frustrating when it was not my fault.
Ben gave me a clear explanation of why my order would be later than initially indicated.
"Dreadful customer service with a clear lack of respect for their customers.Spent over £300 on orders which were expected next day. Received an email to confirm & on the day of delivery I received a text confirming the time slot.So far so good. Until the delivery time came and went, and then the next day.. and the next day. I raised the issue to ASOS via email - no reply (and getting quite worried as I hadn't received any updates.)Raised the query again via their chat service. No adequate answer given apart from a pre-written message stating ""For order number XXXXXXX I can see you were refunded XXX GBP on the X December 2019. Please allow 10 working days for the funds to appear in your account.""I asked for clarification, and was told that if I wanted the items I would have to re-order (not possible since 90% of the items are now out of stock). Some back and forth with the rep and I was advised ""If you have any further questions please visit our help pages"", the chat was closed as I continued to type.Still £300 down and awaiting a refund for an order I never received. Won't waste my time with ASOS again."
"My package never arrived and I contacted to chat with customer service.  Lucy was able to sort out the problem, and help me with the replacement order swiftly."
Had my GHD's drop kicked over my back fence by Hermes. Customer service at Asos shrugged it off. I won't be shopping with them again.
"I ran into an issue where I only received notice that 2 of the 6 items I returned in one parcel were received. I spoke with Amaar through the chat box and Amaar couldn't have been more helpful! Amaar was extremely pleasant and asked all of the right questions and was patient with me when I needed to go pull up my email to get information to him. I have chatted with a handful of reps on this platform with Asos and to be honest, I've been so disappointed each time the conversations were done and most all of my previous conversations never ended with being resolved,  just kind of a ""sorry but can't do anything""....Amaar is the type of person that ASOS needs more of. I'm not kidding - I buy a TON of stuff from ASOS...like, a lot...and if I communicated with someone like him (let alone if anyone did that ran into an issue), they'd walk away wanting to continue to shop with ASOS."
Jadine was beyond helpful. Friendly and polite and sorted each of my issues. Expected it to be a lot longer but she spent time making sure each problem was sorted so I could go on my holiday without worrying.
Leanne was wonderful in helping me sort my issue quickly and smoothly.
Great chat service
She was very helpful .
Quick solution
fast and helpfule
Hibo was extremely helpful and went out of her way to help solve my query.
interlocuteur aimable et qui s'exprime clairement
"Thomas was very helpful, but ASOS need to do better with their returns policy. This is an on going issue which makes me hesitant to shop with ASOS when I can use other vendors whose return policy, although the same as ASOS, don't make their customers wait for their funds to be processed back in their account."
"Michaela was honest about delays and queues, and completely transparent about the fact I wasn't going to get my parcel when I expected to. She gave me all of my options with a recommendation on what would fix the issue fastest. She was so kind and helpful, and I appreciate that so much."
Great service
"I have been waiting for a package for over a month. When talking to customer service, they advised me to check with my neighbors or other safe spots like behind the garbage and recyling bins incase it was put there.... they then told me that it may be at my local post office, but were not able to tell me what company or provide a tracking number. THEN they told me to check back in 3 weeks from now and they can assist me further. Until then, they can't assist. It is a Xmas present that i ordered that they wont help me find. I will never use this site again and i suggest no one else does either. Terrible customer service."
Marie was so helpful and the experience when very quick!
Response was immediate and my issue was solved quickly
"I am absolutely fuming! After waiting for five minutes for the initial reply, with me asking for some indication that anyone was even there to help me, Alexandru finally replied asking me to wait while he had a look into my order. I waited a further 10 minutes for him to come back to which he said that Asos has had to increase delivery times with no advice on what I can do next as I already knew this!! My initial message told you that I noticed in my confirmation email of my order that the standard delivery times had drastically increased from the usual 3 days to over a week. My issue is that I need my items this week for an event and that I feel misled as the website was wholly unclear prior to confirming the order that the new standard delivery was a date pulled at random in the distant future. After reading over his reply, I began typing my response and he sent an additional message to say that as I have not replied he is going to end the conversation, which is ridiculous as I know he can see me typing and it had only been two minutes!! So I started to type faster hoping to send it but he ended the chat immediately!! I am absolutely livid at the lack of respect, I would have just accepted a simple apology initially once I received the information I needed but now I am furious over the awful customer service experience. I'm so shocked that such a reputable company like Asos has disappointed me so much in what should have been such a simple conversation."
"Asos, is one trusted site, prompt in attending to any issues, concerning delivery, replacements or refunds. you can be rest assured to received what you see online. thank you asos it's been 6years shopping from this site. amazing..."
"Great service. Couldn't remember if I was verified for student ID. Talked to customer service and they help me out. Turns out I was. Could have been nice if there was somewhere you could see, if you have a verified student-account or not."
Friendly. Very quick response
Quick and easy to use
Asos always responds quickly and usually a useful response. The only thing that concerns me-as with all online companies is the lack of transparency on where their returned/faulty products go. I hope it’s not landfill!
Estimated delivery is December 10th and I already received my order.  It took only 3 days from the order date and it is an international delivery. That's excellent.
Customer service Wizard
Quick and helpful customer services
"Unhelpful exchange, I have not received any answers and do not know when I can expect to hear back from Asos. I am extremely disappointment at this poor customer service."
Very professional attitude and willing to help with the issue that I had. Customer service agent was really polite and it didn't take long to solve the issue.
Great customer service and help from Channa today! Polite and helpful! Stands out due to other recent customer help centres for big brands being terrible. Well done ASOS and well done Channa!
Had a faulty item in my order. Contacted ASOS through the live chat system and Priyanka was very helpful in resolving my issue. Thanks for making this a smooth and pleasant shopping experience (:
"Very poor customer service. As a premium subscriber who has paid extra for yearly next day delivery, I asked where my parcel was as it had already been 4 days since I placed the order. I was then told that I shouldn't expect it for another two days due to delays and that as a premium subscriber I'm not exempt from potential delays. I was then palmed off and told that they would be ending the customer service chat as there was nothing they could do and they wouldn't be reimbursing me for the extra I paid for next day delivery. Awful service overall and very confusing why anyone would pay for a premium next day delivery service which doesn't actually deliver."
"Quick and helpful, with a lovely charm."
"Fast response, and cleared the problem nicely"
The customer support representative was very kind and helpful. He answered all the questions and provided the necessary information.
"Good experience, and stuff are always on help!"
"Mia was informative, quick and very nice!5*"
Great support through the online chat regarding a faulty item!
Gurzala was quick to action on my problem and also provide an alternative solution.
Christopher was a GREAT HELP !
She had a great attitude and demeanor. April worked really well and gave me all the information I needed.
Fab customer service. Had an online chat with Lauren about a missing item and she dealt with it swiftly and professionally.
Very helpful!
Very polite and helpful. No complaints at all.
"Elliot did not resolve my issue but that's not his fault same as it's not  in his control.Waiting time was not too long.Relevant info has been provided.Please do improvements in the delivery service – in my case, I am unable to change the delivery address of my order. Would be a handy feature though."
"I am utterly disgusted with the substandard service I received today. I pay for next day delivery and I am having to wait 13 days for my parcel to arrive. Apparently it was my fault, even though EVERY time I place an order It gets sent on my premier delivery. They would do nothing about it and were frankly RUDE to me and said 'well we didn't unselect it for you Beth'. I do not pay for NEXT DAY for it to come in 13 days!!!!"
Problem sorted using the live chat in few minutes.very trustable company
I needed help to return an item without a returns note. Received really straight forward helpful advice resolved my query in less than 10 minutes. Thanks to Rebecca. 😊
"Great outcome, however, the agent was silent for the first 12 minutes so i wasn't sure i was connected."
"I was talking to Elliot, he was very nice and helped me with my problem!"
"I've been having issues with delivery from Asos with hermes, they havent delivered 6 orders I've placed in the last 3 weeks conservatively and Asos havent done nothing about it, and I'm subscribed to a yearly delivery.Asos have turned into a joke now, and I'd advice anyone not to shop with them."
Amy was fantastic with re ordering my order
"Customer service used to be amazing with ASOS, and having been a customer for around 5+ years used to shop here daily. But over the last year as company has grown more they have lost touch with the consumer.I pay for premier delivery and over the last year have had 4 plus problems, recently I had to chase my delivery as was 6 days late with no response from them, after chasing told has been a problem and will dispatch a replacement which I agreed to but i quickly checked on the site and it was out of stock! Which the adviser did not even tell me about! 6 days late and not a sorry or a word from ASOS until I chased. Thankfully amazon came to the rescue."
thanks for your help
Chatted to some people using the live chat and the first time was getting my student discount code and the 2nd asking why it wasn't working. Although simple questions both people were super helpful and were able to give me answers to my questions within minutes. Means I could get back to shopping their awesome deals even faster!
Always order from you and always pleased with my items and delivery time
The customer service agent was prompt to my replies and provided a quick solution to my issue.
"Quick and effective, 10/10 service from Claude :)"
"Very poor service, 3-5 day delivery has now turned into an 11 day delivery... which was NOT stated at checkout... otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered!! Contacted ASOS to see what options there was to receive parcel quicker.. nothing they could do other than me reordering items for next day delivery, but also wouldn’t issue a refund to pay for another order of the SAME items. I’m disgusted by the service. A very very well known brand and website and it’s appalling service has put me off ever using them again."
"Daisy, was very Kind."
Thanks for dealing nice and quick reply to my questions
"Sabah was fast, efficient and helpful. Dead chuffed :)"
Jamie was awesome very helpful and patient
"Liberty was very helpful and efficient on Live chat this afternoon, thanks again!"
Very helpful and understanding and put me at ease
Gabriella the best!
"Quick, efficient and easy-to-use"
ASOS is not able to fulfil their orders in the time frame stated! I placed an order on Friday and even though I have next day delivery it said the estimated delivery date would be the 4th of December. I got an email saying they where extremely busy and I would receive an email confirmation in a few hours. When I received the confirmation approx 8 hours later the delivery address was pushed to the 11th of December. I immediately tried to cancel but I was unable to as it was outside the hour period. I needed to cancel or amend the address as I am moving to France on the 5th of December.I have been told that I cannot cancel or amend the address even though it’s not being dispatched for 10 days. And it’s an error on their end as they are not fulfilling the orders in the time they stated. What Asos have suggested is no 1 that I illegally access the property I am vacating - even though I have said on a number of occasions that I will be in a different country.The 2nd suggestion which disgusts me is that they are willing to let the order me packaged. Then sent to a currier for delivery - once the currier attempts a number of times it will then be returned to Asos. If the order is returned to Asos they will then process a refund. I am disgusted at how much of a waste of time and money this is. Not to mention the affect this will have on the environment if this is their solution to this issue. It is also a waste of my money and they have no regard that the order may go missing.I will be boycotting Asos until they find a way to be more sustainable. Or show come care towards their workers and they environment. Absolute disgrace!
Quick deliveries and very quick and helpful with any queries I raised.Love this online shop!
Excellent communication and a very speedy response.
May... Amazing name with an amazing behavior .. it looked like bringing the spring to me for few minutes.. in this cold winter day..Thank you May. And continue to bring springs to people:)
"ASOS have been very good with prices, selection, dispatching orders and handling returns. The customer service is excellent. Unfortunately it is the delivery company they use in my area, Hermes, which continually disappoints (missing and late deliveries!). DPD used to deliver in the past and were always on time. This is the only area that needs rectifying."
"Disgusting customer service, could do way more for your customers and some feedback for john. would be best not to be so argumentative"
"i spoke to Natika, she was fantastic! She helped resolve my problems quickly and professionallythanks very much"
Quick and helpful
"Extremely unhappy with the service ASOS have provided and I am a very disappointed customer! Firstly I initially wasn’t aware or even made aware that my order had been cancelled last Thursday !!! After having waited in for the order with no luck I logged in to my account to find it had been cancelled! I find it insulting after contacting ASOS that they indicated this was because of my payment as this was NOT anything to do with my payment details as I had since used the saved payment details on their site. I believe it was because ASOS simply can not deal with the demand of customers ordering on the deals you have offered on Black Friday ! And then don’t even bother to let the customer know! Secondly, not only were some of the items now out of stock which again, was not my fault as I had correctly ordered them on Thursday, I then find it very disappointing that when having to re-order these items I can not even get them on next day delivery, despite having paid for the premier delivery service! I would not be recommending the premier delivery service to anyone in future and will also happily explain how you have failed in this area and take it further! I am very unhappy about this and would like to log a formal complaint with the way in which this order was dealt with. Poor customer service from a big company! A very unhappy customer and unprofessional service!"
Excellent service today.
alycia was very helpful
"I asked why my orders from PRIOR to black friday were changed from the premier next day delivery that I have paid for to standard delivery - I was informed that it was my fault for not looking at check out and seeing that ASOS had suspended next day delivery service temporarily during their busy period, but this seems unfair to me as premier members were not informed ahead of time that their paid next day delivery service would be taken away temporarily. It would have been faster for me to place my orders the following Monday than it will be for the orders I placed last Thursday and Friday...not very impressed by this!"
Helpful customer service despite complicated return.
Vickey was very helpful and talking to her was easy! Great customer service.
very helpful! easy and simple.
Krissy was great and very helpfull!
great service
"Not really satisfied with how my inquiry with returns was dealt with, nor the return process in general. I placed a large order and one item didn’t fit. After it was sent back it was credited to my klarna account instead of a gift voucher (so I can reorder the item). It’s kind of a dumb loophole and will make me wary about ordering/returning online."
April was really helpful. Asos are great but they need to knock Hermes on the head! Rubbish! Dpd in my experience are much more reliable.
"I would like to appreciate Bethany's assistance with the help of checking the status of my order details, Bethany's was really nice, kind and Helpful.I'm very satisfied with her help and service.Thank You Very Much Bethany, Keep up the great work :)"
"I needed help with an order, as one order would be delivered on my paid for next day premier delivery on the correct date, and the other order wouldn’t be delivered until 10 days later as ASOS had put it through as standard delivery! I go online to chat with someone to help, and John was the most unhelpful ASOS chat worker I have ever come across. There was nothing he was willing to do to help, and wasn’t even able to explain to me why this mistake has been made. My order was for items totalling over £400, so to have to wait so long for this to arrive is just ridiculous! I cannot cancel my order, I cannot get it sent with my other order to come at the same time, so ASOS, thank you for being so unhelpful!"
I am disappointed that you were unable to help me with a lost item. Not only am I out the $200 but I now no longer have the items either.I am a pregnant women who ordered a number of maternity clothes that were not right. I will not be shopping with ASOS again.
ASOS had been great... until there are problems then there is nobody to speak too and it takes forever to sort out (I’ve been on the same problem for 5 weeks now !).
"Improve your customer service please Took me 26 minutes for something I can read from my account, I ask for if my package will be delayed or not, Mr. Antony wrote: I understand, if you don't have any questions, you can close our chat now. Bravo, ASOS, bravo"
chatting with Stephen was great! very professional and pleasant
Very helpful
Super fast response! Thank you!
Ariel was very helpful with my problem
really friendly and sorted the situation super quickly
"He was so helpful and patience, god bless him"
Kevin is quick to respond and helpful and providing help for me. Thanks alot!
Sizanne is the best :)
"Kevin was really helpful, thank you."
was good help even tho i didnt get the problem sorted
Qasim was helpful & efficient He assisted me with processing a return and a refund :)
ASOS chat have been an absolute nightmare to deal with! I have had endless trouble over the past few months and have spoken to more than 5 different people on their chat system. All but one were rude and unhelpful. They all took an age to reply to anything and then one said they couldn't help and closed the chat before I could respond!I have to give some thanks to Oludayo who was the only person who actually explained what the problem was to me and gave me a solution so thank you!As soon as I can get access again to my account I will be cancelling my subscription to the 'premier delivery service' (which I haven't been able to use despite paying for!) and never using them again!! It is such a shame as ASOS used to be so good but they have gone massively down hill
"Great customer service , he didn’t give me the run around at all, very straight to the point and helpful aswell , GIVE BEN A RAISE!"
Excellent customer care
Quick advice and resolution
Really fast and great
"Fast, Friendly SupportGreat support seeking to resolve issues right away.Thanks Chloe for your help on a Monday Morning"
To be honest I didn’t even want to leave one star but I couldn’t complete the review without pressing something. ASOS customer service or lack of is atrocious. My parcel was meant to arrive next day (I pay an annual subscription). Asos online chat can’t contact Hermes. Hermes lied and said they tried to deliver when they clearly didn’t as I was at home and also have CCTV. I now have to wait a week to allow them time to deliver my next day delivery. Go figure!! Why do company’s bother with Black Friday promotions if they can’t fulfil delivery?
"My order is now estimated to be delivered on the 9th December, when I was told it was meant to be delivered December 2nd, I would never of placed my order with Asos if I knew this to begin with. I am now in a position when I dont have clothing I require, because I was informed poorly by yourself. So just wondering what you are going to offer as compensation for this poor service.I spoke to Mitchell one of your customer service team, he was extremely unhelpful and rude and is blaming me the problem, when I was never informed correctly of the issue."
"Very helpful, thank you"
"Quick efficient, great service overall from Jaslien!"
Morgan was great.
Horrible customer care. I had a problem with an order as I had been charged a delivery but I had purchased a free delivery pass prior to order the item so I contacted customer care via chat to request a delivery fee refund for that particular order. When and contacted customer care I was taken care by Kirsteen. This person states that the order was placed in standard delivery so she wasn't going to issue the refund. I place three order that day and only that didn't go through with regards to the free delivery. I asked for at least a voucher to cover that fee as you can see that it was a mistake and I was going to place more order. This person wouldn't listen to what I was saying and closed the chat. This is an horrible customer service. I work in customer service myself and I don't understand this behaviour toward a customer.
"Purchased Premium Delivery for a year on 28th November and used it to order one item. After this, my Premium Delivery has not been activated. It has been 4 days now, still nothing. I need several items urgently for an event this week, no one seems to care. Customer service are doing literally nothing, no solution to my problem. Now I have to search for these items elsewhere (very last minute), thank you Asos, I will not be using your services again. Let's see how long the refund takes..."
Penny was really understanding and helpful
They close accounts without any further explanation! Awful customer service!
always great service from ASOS
Excellent always a pleasure
Great customer care service. They always help with all the issues. Really love shopping there
Great customer service!
Amy sorted my query super fast - quick and efficient live chat service!
great customer service and sorted out my problem straight away :)
"The customer service representative was really helpful, however it took me 58:20 minutes just to solve a minor issue. I did this chat service when I finished work, at home with a computer. I tried doing it with my mobile phone, It didn't connect properly. I had to keep on refreshing. Also the 58 minutes of solving an issue is a bit too much, which in my opinion can be done in less than 5 minutes on a phone call when talking in person.Overall, Renee was lovely into helping in solving my issue and hope she's always having a wonderful day."
Emma was excellent... thanks for your help regarding my refund....ive spoken to 4 different customer service advisers and youve been the most helpfull
chat was helpful and polite!
Quick to respond and clear concise answer. Thank you
Helpful c. Good
"The customer help on the chat facility were great but the ordering system was appalling. Placed and order which they then cancelled for some reason and cannot tell me why. They sent an email telling me they had cancelled and to respond to it if I had any questions. I responded, they didn't. Used their on-line chat and Kevin was very helpful and polite even though there was nothing he could do.  So 5 stars for Kevin and 1 star for ASOS"
I still don't know where my order is and Asos has no way of finding out.
Sara was great
I was bought a gift voucher and made a return and now the original gift voucher is split into three due to returns at different times. I am now not able to use the money for one purchase even though it was bought as a gift. I have to buy three things with the three different vouchers.  Total con. I then got in touch to speak to a manager and they dont have any.  Joke!
"Customer service helpline specifically chat now. Oliver has been a great help as a customer service agent understanding and all kinds of patient regarding my order that has yet to reach me. Unlike MIsty, one of your customer service agents who sounded hostile with an attitude and do not sound keen to help. This has to be improved."
Great service!
Customer service was quick to resolve issue
Totally helpful
"What started out as an horror story of an issue with fedex was resolved by Aden and the social media team At ASOS. who actually took the time to listen to my problem, research the issue and resolve the issue. I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome. Thank you guys!"
This was my first ever order and I didnt get them and the only thing the could do was refund my money as the product was there any more.
Lisa was very understanding and patient. I appreciate that she was trying to help with my current situation that is very frustrating. Hope to get the issue resolved soon.
Nigel able to assist on my query.
"Worst experience ever!!I placed the order on 13th November 2019 and waited till 26th November when I got a mail that my parcel was being sent back to the sender because no one was available for the pick up. The address I put down was my office address, and I also ticked the option to leave the parcel at a safe space just in case the whole office called a sickie. Anyway, after trying multiple times to contact ASOS, I received a mail from them saying that I have to wait till they receive the parcel back n then they would issue a refund. This process should be done by 2nd December at the latest. And here we are. Nothing from them, no communication. And despite of my multiple tries to use their ""Chat now"" option, it NEVER works!! I tried emailing, no response and ultimately facebook messenger, where they copy n paste the same thing again and again and send it to me!!Honestly, super frustrated. This was my first and last purchase from ASOS!!"
"My order arrived  but the shirt was missing. After getting in touch with them, they were able to sort a replacement in no time! Big thanks to Mohammed for dealing with it quickly :)"
"ASOS has the most outstanding customer service possible hands down.. There is no other company with higher standards for great customer service than ASOS. I ordered some wedding dresses to elope with the love of my life in NYC. Since I was so nervous, I ordered a few just in case the dress I wanted didn't work out. No one wants to look less than their best on their wedding day. There was a little mixup with my order and my return, but in the end I got the most perfect dress I loved and returned the ones that didn't work out. ASOS was so nice about the whole thing and they even gave me my dress I wore that day for free as a wedding present to keep, which was a total surprise! I feel so lucky that I got my most perfect dress, from a company I truly love. My special day was just made even more special. I'll definitely shop with ASOS again and again."
Sean was very patient with me. I was very frustrated that ASOS could not do more for me but that wasn't his fault. I appreciated how he handled my frustration. That must be hard to do with unsatisfied customers. Thanks Sean
Feels like you having a chat with bot
Customer service were no help considering your website wouldn’t allow editing of an order. I was within the timeframe and instead was directed here.
Aaron resolved my refund issue within 5 minutes. Super painless and my refund is processing within the next few days. Thank you!
Thanks for help
"We live in the USA, for some reason it directed us to the UK site.Even after we entered a US shipping address it allowed the order to go through.This is after offering us ""2 day shipping"" for a yearly fee, to then inform us it will take over 2 weeks to get our order!!!After reviewing our order and reading the confirmation emails, and realizing what's going on, we tried to cancel the order (a little over an hour after placing the order,)  and it did not allow us!And the dont even have a costumer service call center!!!"
Misty was great. She was very helpful and answered all my questions in a timely manor.Thank you Misty!
friendly and super helpful - Rebecca was great
Resolved unknown tracking detailsReprepsentative was able to locate new tracking details that the courier had not provided. Hope to see overdue packaged delivered soon!
"Great products, fast delivery options and good customer service."
"I love that ASOS does free returns - It really helps because online shopping can be so hit or miss. Some clothes don't have the best quality but over all, there's a lot to choose from on ASOS so I can usually find a couple different options to order. The returns process is really easy and every time I've contacted customer service they've been super helpful."
i got my question answered.
"I have shopped with ASOS for years, they have always been my first point of call if I ever want to buy anything online. I’ve never had ANY issues with them until this year.I placed 3 orders using Klarna, all of which sadly included either faulty/incorrect items. I’ve been unwell so my return was late, only by a few days, however it did not even cross my mind that this would be an issue since my orders were incorrect/faulty.ASOS have issued gift vouchers for the orders- when I raised my concern I was told that it would be passed to a “specialist team”. Almost a week later I had to chase them for a response, to which I was told “these orders will be refunded by 5th December”. I thought that the issue was resolved.The next day I was told that the previous person informed me incorrectly and that NO refunds are being issued.Consumer rights act 2015 states that BY LAW a customer can return incorrect/faulty orders, or items that are generally not fit for purpose within 6 months of receiving them. ASOS appear to be convinced that they are above consumer law and almost 2 weeks on they are still trying to bully me into backing down. It’s shocking to think how many customers they have done this to who probably have backed down because they’ve not been aware of their rights. ASOS are fraudulent bullies and I can assure you that I will NOT be backing down."
"Great customer service, quick and easy!"
"Easy and quick, Mahad was helpful and provided helpful assistance"
"I had a query about a return that I had not received an email confirmation nor refund for. The chat service instantly opened and a cc rep called Benjamin responded straight away. He quickly told me that they did receive it and apologised that the refund was taking some time but reassured me I would have an email within 48 hours. So quick, efficient and friendly. Fair play Asos, and thank you!"
Great service on their chatline. Had very good advice and help from Munawar. Will definitely use the chatline again when needing advice.
Thank you for addressing my concerns.
Great service overall. Never experienced any delays in ordering nor refunds. Top Stuff!!
Abdirahman was very professional and efficient.
Dealt with quickly and efficiently and very caring understanding thanks johnathan
"Response from Daniel was prompt and efficient.  He was able to advise me the course of action to take - ie. where to look for the information previously sent to me - and then next step was him referring my query to the correct team.Hopefully now, the rest of the team will follow through and info / email will be back to me shortly.Thanks, Shawn"
I spoke with Mahad. Our conversation was very helpful. Quick and specific.
Good and fast reply
The operater was helpful and friendly
Terrible delivery delays
"I made my first purchase with ASOS this week. I was a bit skeptical after hearing varying stories about the quality and the service. I was however pleasantly surprised. The dress I ordered was lovely but had to return it as I was not the correct woman for that style! But  Abdirahman on the ""chat"" advised me how to return and reassured me that they wouldn't blame me for the dress having quite a strong smell of nice but very sweet perfume as it turned up that way!  will order again.."
easy and helpful
ASOS were really helpful and easy to deal with.
"What a JOKE, tried to order something and went to sign in, when it came up as account blocked. Went to the customer chat for help and they were not helpful at all. Rather than wanting to help just ended the chat. I only have one address and they kept saying it doesn't match. the assistants name was Rebecca and i have saved the chat to share if you are actually willing to help?"
"I had to return two items, because the sizes were incorrect. After I returned both, I was only given credit for one and ASOS refused to give me credit for the other item that I returned, because a promo code was applied at checkout. Basically, after I returned two items, the total amount that I spent dropped below the minimum ($250) required for me to use the promo code. While I understand the reasoning, I'd say that most of the stores would have refunded the amount as credit, but ASOS did not. Not the smartest thing to do when trying to grow clientele. I will highly recommend ASOS to consider giving refunds to customers even after they return items after using the promo codes, as most stores do, especially because customers will only know whether the size was correct after trying them on and I feel that I am being punished for doing so here."
"I had an issue with an order not being delivered, I used the asos help chat and spoke to a lovely girl called Elysha who was more than happy to help with my problem, I found the chat service helped speed up resolving the issue rather than waiting for emails back and forth over the course of a few days, I would recommend the help chat to resolve any of your problems as the service is instant and the customer service is outstanding."
Jordan was very helpful with my return. Although it has taken over 3 weeks to get it and i had to chase it.
"Patient, informative and helpful"
Its was fast and answered to my problem Thax for rebecca
quick and easy
"Thanks so much for your help, very professional"
"ASOS are a massive company, and do not care for customers, they are money grabbing, and polluting our environment. I tried to cancel an order that wasn’t due for delivery until the 11th of December, (it is the 1st of December right now) and I couldn’t cancel the delivery of my parcel, due to me missing the cancellation time. This means my parcel has to be delivered to me, and then Delivered back to them, all because they can’t be bothered to cancel the order, ‘because it has already been packed’, it’s disgusting that a company of that size does not have capacity to look through orders and not deliver the ones which are not needed. All in the hope that the consumer forgets to return the item, and they make money. I will never shop with ASOS again, and I will always deter my friends from using them. They have just cost themselves more money, for me returning the item, and them having to pay the postage fee,"
Worst customer service and courier - fraudulent and never deliver parcels but claim you signed for them! Never shopping here again.
"Overall a very good service, extremely helpful and quick to resolve a missing parcel which is down to the couriers."
Takes too long to response
Lisa was very polite and helpful!!
Great service and customer support
Thank you Jerrome for helping me out on this and I’m very grateful for all the help and enquires that you have helped me on this
"yeah my operator LEITH was a great help, easy to talk to and understanding 10/10 training, give this man a raise!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"real review non of this fake sh!t asos has good costumer service and quick deliveries, it also has high quality products i recommend this site for online shopping"
Laura helped me receive a refund for express delivery due to delays. She was very helpful and understanding!
Customer service always solve the problems!
I really like asos. I order pretty much every week- maybe more than once.what I would highlight is their amazing customer service team. there hasn't once been a time when they could not help me.really good
"Terrible customer service. I tried contacting yall MULTIPLE times. I didnt get a response. I was left in a cue for like 90 minutes and then it expired. I tried contacting yall multiple times no one answered it was pointless. and when I was finally able to get ahold of someone (3 days later) I was told ""theres nothing we could do"" so it was all for nothing. I wasted so much time on hold FOR NO REASON. terrible customer service. I miss your customer service from 2 years ago. I am SUCH a loyal customer ive made all my friends shop with you guys. I almost exclusively shop from asos so you can only imagine my disappointment."
"Changed my delivery date after order placed. When I went onto the online chat the really helpful person from asos told me I should have checked the confirmation email (which comes after you order) and then proceeded to tell me ""now it's too late"" (to cancel within 60mins). I did not ask to cancel. The person was being deliberately antagonistic and didn't actually answer what I asked. When asked for complaints address I was told ""we deal with complaints"". Will not spend another penny with them."
On more than one occasion ASOS has failed to correctly refund for items that I've returned. They recently removed the option of next day delivery due to demand even though I've subscribed to their Premier Delivery service.
did nothing to help and says site rules
Great quick customer service. Issue with parcel not arriving and ASOS were fantastic in getting it sorted and they responded quickly to all questions. Great professional friendly service!
laura was super helpful and friendly
"Laura from ASOS live chat was very helpful, she got to the bottom of the issue and my anxiety is diminished!"
Extremely quick and helpful.  Fully satisfied.
Always had very quick and effective service from Asos live chat and it is because of this I have purchased so often. Also the delivery options have not let me down the same way other companies have.
Very helpful customer service!
I had some issues with my refunds and Laura was really helpful when I used the customer service chat feature. Got through after only a minute of waiting and she quickly sorted my issues. Thanks Laura!
Andrew was very helpful in solving my issue with an undelivered ASOS package via Hermes delivery.
Long hold and return policy needs reviewed but advisor was great
"Unfortunately, customer service is not polite at all... Solutions are slow to be found or never found. I am honestly disappointed. Customer service is the reason I will stop using Asos even though they have a great stock. Anyway... I hope it improves. Most of the competitive websites are miles better."
Customer service from Chelsea was AMAZING. Please see she gets recognition for this.
"This is the second time I have had to deal with ASOS for a problem with their couriers. ASOS have been great in dealing with my problem. Quick and efficient in dealing with my request. I had to wait for 30 minutes to speak to someone using thier online chat service but this may be because it was Black Friday weekend. Despite this issue, I will use them again."
I bought what I thought an amazing jumpsuit to celebrate mine and my boyfriends birthday.I paid £40 and the material used was not what I was excepted at all... my jumpsuit completely ripped on the bus! This was extremely humiliating and ruined my mood.The quality of the product was extremely poor. I'm very upset has I waited a month to used this product on this special occasion.Patricia Horta
"Ordered something black Friday as a replacement since the original order I made the day before was a shambles! I received an item that didn't even have tags and seemed worn, but the worst of it I received a NON-ASOS item which was a ragged dirty stained stinking Ralph Lauren polo which someone has obviously sent out instead of what I ordered. I contacted ASOS who didn't have a care in the world about how they had sent me someone's dirty top and didn't offer to help fix the situation considering the top I actually ordered was now out of stock and it would be unlikely that I could buy it again at the Black Friday price. Good luck to you if you ever have an issue as you will receive automated generic responses from people who aren't interested at all. The shock of receiving someone's perfectly folded tissue wrapped old manky t-shirt shows it must have been someone who works there! Either that or they just send orders out in the dark!!!"
Very helpful and dealt with my query quickly.
"Usually great service but placed an order on Black Friday and the delivery date is 11th December, despite paying £10 a year for premium delivery (why bother!). In the T&C’s they’ve covered themselves in case of this so I have no comeback, but yesterday the premium delivery was back up and running- which means that an order placed yesterday/today will be prioritised delivery wise over mine, which is so irritating!"
"I ordered two parcels a week and a bit ago with my premier delivery as I always do - usually little to no problems - this time, didn’t turn up. Was obviously not impatient enough to deal with it immediately, but a few days in and still no parcels I was irked. Was told when I contacted ASOS that this couldn’t be dealt with until a week later - why? No explanation given. As a premier customer, I was just told that this happens and that it’s in the terms - so basically, pay your subscription and accept if it goes wrong, as a company, they’ll do little to help.  Once that week was up, I was simply told that they didn’t know where they’d gone and would try and get replacements. Bare in mind, both products are currently on the site as out of stock - something that they weren’t a few days ago which if ASOS had dealt with already, would of been with me. Didn’t even have the audacity to suggest pushing the orders quickly, but rather usual standard delivery if everything goes smoothly. It will not!"
very helpful and informative
quick to respond and help me out straight away
EXCELLENT service!!!!
Courtnay was very friendly and helped me with my problem efficiently!
Very helpful chat with Danielle about a missing item from my parcel. No stress whatsover. Happy with the other items which were delivered with lots of information about tracking.
Customer service extremely unhelpful regarding lost order. Waited 45 mins to talk to an operator for her not be able to help in the slightest.
Good combination of price and quality
Awful customer service. They did not offer a solution to my problem and the staff couldn’t have cared less about my bad experience with them. They had an attitude of deal with it or cancel your order we get thousands of orders and we don’t care about issues with your one order.
Great customer service as usual.
"Nice products, good customer service, improve delivery."
After paying for next day delivery I waiting in my home the allotted time frame and 2 hours after to make sure I was home for my parcel because I had a prior engagement that evening which is why I needed my delivery...after it jot turning up and being given a half arsed excuse from the online chat....the order never arrived....I’m also still waiting for my refund for delivery and we are now 2days after the estimated delivery and it still isn’t here....tried tracking my order with the delivery company and it hasn’t yet reached them? Yet Asos has stated multiple times it’s left the warehouse and with the delivery company? Was then sent an email saying my delivery is delayed until the next working day....15 minutes later I received another email stating I would be receiving my parcel today?....4 hours later once again and I’m still waiting for it? With no response from ASOS...what is going on?
He tried to help me and was decent to me so far it seems very promising but I hope what he said will actually be true.if it does he was excellent.
although it took a week or two to put thought an enquiry but the team tried to look into the case and respond professionally. In general I'm satisfied with the service. Thanks Martin and Jessica.
Bad customer service and no contact number. Just do it in store and don’t waste your time.
"An item I ordered was reduced by £20 the day I received it. I was told I couldn't get the difference refunded and that I would have to return the original, have that refunded, and then order a new item. Bit of a faff on, but the CS I received was very helpful."
"Prompt reply, clear response, great customer service."
Great customer service fast and helpful!!! Mihaela was amazing!!
"werner was an amazing customer service agent, willing to help me with everything i asked. he definitely made me feel more comfortable in buying from your website while i was always afraid about the sizes of the products. well done, really appreciate it"
Excellent customer service from Luke today who resolved my delivery issue within minutes. Great to see x
I hope it ends good
terrible. delivery driver fraudulently claimed I signed for the package and asks failed to resolve 2 separate queries regarding items going missing
Worst service that i ever witnessedDont buy from those lieres who dont take responsibility
Luke was lovely and personalised his messages :)
Navpreet quickly helped to solve my issue.
Very friendly and helpful
Parcel arrived damaged and missing an item.  Customer services did not quibble and sent through refund etc right away. Lovely assistant online. Thank you
Always ordering on asos. Quality is great and if i need help they always help :) Needed vat invoice and Mihaela arranged it very fast.
Instead of receiving a refund I got a gift card instead. It was not made clear at all on the returns slip and given that it was a new change in Asos' policy I feel it should have been clearly stated on the slip that a refund would not be generated after 28 days to avoid customer confusion. I assumed 45 days would still follow the exact same returns policy procedure. If I had known I would have made sure to send the items back within 28 days.
Quick replies.
Very helpful and accomodating staffAlways with a reply to my every queryThank you!!
Vlad was very friendly and very helpful! Thanks again :)
Excellent customer service from Olivia
"Paid and ordered a years next day delivery, when I went to use it there was no option. Still waiting for my delivery 5 days later no one is responding to me on any of their platforms. Do not pay for the next day delivery as it’s clearly a con."
Navpreet was very helpful with answering my query sufficiently and with speed.
Mihaela was super helpful and responded almost instantly. The issued was passed onto a specialist team but Mihaela gave me a temporary solution whilst I waited. Fantastic customer service!
"I bought a lovely coat from Asos but unfortunately some of the stitching came undone in the armpit. I didn't want to return it for a brand new one as wasn't sure if my size was still in stock but Asos offered to refund the cost of repair and now my coat is good as new. This is a really excellent policy for the environment, our wardrobes and our tailoring industries. Good on you asos! And great customer service."
"Took a while to get through since it's Black Friday/week and the site/chat staff are probably inundated with orders and customers, but when I did, Vicky was so, so helpful esp since i have anxiety and can get really, REALLY stressed over potential delays, unresolved issues etc. They were understanding and sorted out my issues (blocked account and my worries that i wouldn't get a refund for a returned order made on the blocked account) so fast!!"
"I have shopped with ASOS for several years now and I have never had any trouble with any deliveries, items have always arrived on time and as shown on website. Any problems have been resolved within a quick time. Customer service is excellent. ASOS have a wide range of products available from their own brand as well as other well-known brands. A great place to shop! Only downside - YOU NEED A STORE :D I love ASOS. Thank you for your great products and customer service."
"Well I mean, ASOS itself is obviously great, massive selection yada yada yada, but this review is mainly for the customer service I just received. Although I was on hold on live chat for about 40 minutes before getting through to Stuart, it was black Friday weekend, and ASOS had reduced literally everything on their website, so I wasn't surprised. I thought multiple days worth of my orders had been cancelled as I'd had ominous emails sent my way, but Stuart reassured me that thankfully my ridiculous spending spree was still going to eat away at my credit card allowance. Thanks Stuart! Now, back to ASOS...."
after 36 minutes waiting I have a chat with someone😡😡. The girl it was very good and helpful but for everything else bad.
"I usually love ASOS live chat - usually very helpful HOWEVER i ordered on thursday, expecting delivery saturday because i could have missed the cut off. decided to chat with them which it took a good HOUR to even connect for the lady to tell me my parcel hasnt even left the warehouse!? The lady was obviously apologetic and i stressed i was not angry with her but the fact that i pay for next day delivery for a year and its not even bloody worth it when its likely going to come 5 days after delivering!!! understand its a busy time of year but 1 hour to get onto live chat is a joke and to find out my parcel hasnt even left the warehouse is an even bigger joke!!!"
"I ordered a dress from Asos and they gave it to Hermes to deliver. Hermes delivered it to a wrong address.  I tried to get in touch with Asos but it was simply impossible. Up until now my dress is missing and I haven't heard from them.I would advise people to be careful when ordering with them because,  they may not even receive their items."
I have had multiple orders from asos now and the first time I have a problem (which was with the delivery the fact it was missing so not asos) I did an online chat and they have sent out a replacement straight away which I am relieved about.
Paige was so nice!!!
"Buyer beware, customer service is terrible if you have an issue with your order. Check, check and triple check your order. 3 extra units got added to my order for reasons I cannot explain. I tried to cancel within seconds of receiving the confirmation email but the system did not allow for cancellation. Then when I tried to get online help for someone to remove the extra items and at least issue me a credit so I could purchase something else (they claimed cancellation was impossible) they refused. Seems I will have to endure paying for duplicate items that I never intended to order. They know most won't bother sending them back as the international shipping cost at your own expense just adds to your losses. I wonder how many others were caught out with this same unscrupulous practice. Check the reviews and go with a more reputable company that is willing to correct errors with online ordering systems within minutes of placing the order. Will never use this company again."
"Helpful customer service, once I got through to the Chat function."
"Your costumer service is bad, never have the answers or the willing to help the costumer, hope that someone will read this and do something with that"
"i saw on my account that i have 3 orders!! foe the same item. it was all sattled after a quick chat with Navpreet, thanks"
The person I spoke to from customer service (Qasim) was very patient and helpful but unfortunately he was restricted but ASOS’ unhelpful cancellation and delivery policies.
"Currently in the process of getting an order fixed, and Chelsea was super helpful when I contacted customer care. Thank you!"
"Absolutely the worst place I’ve ever had to deal with, when returning a faulty item. The system didn’t generate a QR code. All email folders checked and account didn’t register a return. Online for three days trying to return an item only to be thrown back to my order page. So unable to return item. Extremely frustrating...  Only form of contact is texting. No one to speak to and they’re unable to access accounts. The service is all about the company And money and NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER."
"I would leave no stars if this was possible. ASOS are just awful. The customer service is appalling, they send incorrect items, don't send items and don't refund. In total i'm sure i have wasted on average 20 hrs dealing with ASOS trying to get things rectified - ASOS' issues I might add. DO NOT USE ASOS."
Was very kind and helpful
prompt answers!Thank you
I had one fellow Marco help me what a nightmare otherwise I'm stressed because of this
I talked to Jamal who was very nice and very attentive to my questions. thank you for the fasts replies
aaron was kind and helpful
weirdest and worst policy for not being able to cancel nor change delivery address even if the parcel hasnt been collected and shipped out. super unreasonable.
"Laura, 2414700. Excellent support"
He was very kind and well guided. I'd like to have another consultation next time.
"I was worried because I thought the product was canceled, but Laura gave me a quick reply so I was less worried. Thank you.Laura and chat number is 24140581"
Amy was efficient and helpful.

"Had some problems with orders being canceld, spoke to kristy in the asos live chat who cleard all the confusion and was really helpful."
"Leith can find the solution to your problem in no time at all. Extremely helpful ,10/10 would recommend."
Abdirahman was great! Helped very quickly and answered my questions wel.
Perfect chat
"Fantastic customer service from ASOS! I shop from ASOS all the time from their great curve range, they are always happy to help with any issues and rectify them immediately!"
Jasmine was great! She was efficient and kind. She was the best customer service rep I have spoken with at ASOS so far.. and I shop on ASOS regularly.
Decent clothing good customer service but the chat app doesn’t work on my phone which is annoying
"I used the live chat feature to try to cancel an order so I can purchase it in a different color. Taun, was very helpful and prompt. I love shopping with Asos."
Helped me greatly!
"Helpful, Fast and accurate"
deanna is very friendly
Customer service staff is prompt to address the issue. Really helpful.
