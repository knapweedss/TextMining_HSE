Overall the service was poor when comparing to other online chat services.","Dec 14, 2019"

Delivery but no watch inside!,"Ordered a Vivienne Westwood which was delivered on time but  arrived sealed but with no watch inside!  Christmas stress!  After initial frustration of trying to find a FAST way to get this resolved (ASOS no phone number and a chat box that kept disappearing unless you were like lightning on keyboard?), I liaised with Donique who resolved this quickly, re-ordering to be delivered within 4 working days.  This has minimized my delivery anxiety, as it is a present for my daughter.  Friendly and efficient service overall and providing it arrives (it was confirmed it was in stock) with watch inside(!), I will be a happy customer again. Sad state of affairs, that people (presumably at packing stage) steal, when the rest of us work hard to earn money to buy these treats. ASOS so far, so good!","Dec 14, 2019"

Shambles of a company DO NOT USE,Items ordered on 1/12 on standard 3-5 day delivery. Got estimated delivery date 11/12. Dispatch 9/12 still no parcel. Contact ASOS who won’t do anything until they speak with currier. Speak to Currier directly says parcel returned due to damage. ASOS won’t accept this for 48hours and now say I have to wait a further 7 days to see if they receive my parcel back and then maybe issue a refund which will take another 7-10 days DO NOT BUT FROM THESE IF YOU’D LIKE TO ACTUALLY GET THE GOODS YOU PAID FOR,"Dec 14, 2019"
Terrible experience,Terrible experience. Courier left my parcel in a gas metre and my parcel was unsealed. One whole outfit from my order was missing and no order info or returns label inside. I complain on FB so ASOS send out a replacement parcel... to an old address I don’t live at anymore! Why on earth would you do that? Wouldn’t common sense tell you to send the parcel to the address of the original order??? I’m absolutely foaming and want my money back. Absolutely useless.,"Dec 14, 2019"

Lack of communication and a very negative experience,I have had a very negative and stressful experience. One of my orders was cancelled and just never arrived so I chased up Asos and finally a replacement order was sent as there was some issue with it apparently. Then when I returned some of the items in my order I did not receive any refund information. I have spent couple of weeks waiting and then sending multiple emails to Asos customer care with no reply. I understand that this is a busy time but I have basically been ignored. I had wanted to do my shopping online to save time and make it easier but it has just been a negative and stressful experience. If I had not kept trying to sort the refund I don't think I would have ever recieved one. I have shopped online many times at Asos but am very upset and disappointed with the service now.,"Dec 14, 2019"

Misleading exchange,"I ordered a variety of items from asos on 29/11/19 and recieved my delivery on 09/12/19. I kept the items that were suitable. 4 items were sent back on 10/12/19 at 13:47. 3 items had been selected for a refund and 1 was requested for an exchange. I recieved an email today at 16:57 stating all of the items had been refunded, which I did not want. I first attempted contact around 7pm but had no luck. I recontacted Asos at 23:08 explaining the occurrence to the unhelpful Marta. I was given this - 'I’ve had a look and can see that we still have the jacket in stock – I’m sorry we weren’t able to replace this for you. It could be that none were available when we went to replace your order, which is why we weren’t able to replace it for you' then this 'as the refund has already been accepted by your bank, we're unable to send a replacement.The refund was processed on 13th December. Please allow up to 10 working days for the money to appear in your account. If you'd like, you could place a new order for the jacket and I'll refund your delivery charge. After you've received your shipping confirmation email, just reply to this email with your new order number - and we'll arrange your refund.' I think offering me free delivery was a terrible option, considering it is a mistake on their part. I mentioned I didn't see why I should be paying the now full price for an item where I had asked for it to be exchanged when it was a mistake on their part. Along with wondering if they had my form to view this error on their end. I got offered a 20% voucher, still not good enough when the item was 30% less and I didn't make an error they did. I opted for their exchange service which they have not honoured. I was then given another sad response 'We would only be able to offer a 20% code. The jacket could have been out of stock at the time, in which scenario we would refund you, but may have come back into stock.I'm not able to get your form, this would be at our warehouse.' The availability of this item in the size I have wanted has consistently been available every day since I sent the item back as that is what the website is still currently showing. I asked for this to be escalated as the outcome was not satisfying as I reiterate they have made the error. I was told it would not be escalated as the sales have ended. What does that matter? An escalation was my request. What I was finally left with... 'I completely understand, however the refund has been accepted by your bank and the price has changed so all I could offer is a 20% goodwill gesture.*my response*[23:25:49] What u are offering isn't enough[23:25:57] I didnt ask for a refundASOS[23:26:10] As I'm not able to help further and I've already given you a 20% promo code, I'll close the chat.[23:26:11] ASOS have ended the chatI think this is a real sign of a company trying to manipulate you to spend more on an item they offer exchanges regardless of being bought in the sale. The mistake is from their end and I am clearly being fobbed off with a good will gesture than a solution. Avoiding this being escalated is truly unprofessional.","Dec 14, 2019"

Honestly, I contacted them on every platform and their response rates were awful, and they were rude as well. I have never been treated so poorly by a company. I had fine experiences with ASOS before, so I thought I could trust them...but this one AWFUL experience outweighs them all. please please dont trust ASOS.Also im looking to write a review straight on the website on the item I purchased and they dont offer reviews per item....THERES A REASON...be cautious","Updated Dec 14, 2019"

worst online shopping site,"I've order here about 5 times-- bad experience every time. I always cave each holiday as it seems like the go-to place to shop and everyone seems to rave about it. Any item I've ordered is always either poor quality or defective. Thin material, sizing has always been off, and colors often are different from what is pictured. Going through customer care is the real nightmare though. It takes weeks to get a refund back. They have a policy that says once they receive it at the warehouse, the customer has to wait 10 ADDITIONAL days for them to ""process it at the warehouse"". Still, after the 10 days I've had to contact them to initiate the refund. They rarely get back via email so it's better to use the live chat feature on the website.

Worst worst worst customer service I…,"Worst worst worst customer service I had yesterday!! I ordered from ASOS on the 3rd of December and chose the next day delivery option. Haven't got any update since from them and have been contacting customer service daily using chat online. Their service was so rude, advicing me to wait until end of each day and if there isn't any progress to contact back in the next day!! I have to apparently wait until the end of 4th working day AFTER MIDNIGHT to contact for a possible refund. But I chose the NEXT DAY DELIVERY OPTION!! The worst bit of the whole experience is I was told off that there is nothing they could do to advice as it was MY FAULT THAT THE LATE DELIVERY BANNER WAS POSTED ON ASOS ON 28 NOVEMBER 2019. I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD READ BEFORE I ORDER IN THE FUTURE. The customer service analyst was also very eager to close the chat and was very sarcastic throughout the conversation.

It was clear the package was missing but they didn’t seem to care. Instead they just said sorry we don’t actually care that you didn’t get it and we can’t get it to you by the 14th. If they had done something about it the first time we messaged them, they could have fixed the problem but it seems that ASOS doesn’t care about customers.

DPD left my parcel in an unsafe place, which i did not ask them to do. This led to my parcel being stolen and I am now out of pocket. I emailed ASOS on Monday for them to review this. I emailed their Care inbox, but received a bounce back saying their inbox was full. I then emailed Nick B, their CEO. So far, I have had no response. I then messaged them on Facebook on Tuesday and still, no response. I have had a few friends also complain to ASOS recently about wrong items being delivered and they have gotten no where with their complaints team.

I recieved the email at half 1 in the morning and the delivery date had changed to the 9th so i called them the next morning and they said due to black friday they had to extend the delivery date. I asked them to cancel it as i needed it for my holiday which they said they couldnt do as i could only cancel an hour after placing the order even though it wasnt despatched. The package was despatched on the 6th and has been with hermes now since sunday, the 9th has been and gone and we are now on the 12th. I called and spoke to asos on rhe 11th who advised i needed to wait 4 days till they can offer a refund. Having just got off the phone to them they have advised i was given the wrong information and i had to wait 7 days after the delivery date.

False advertising,"Be aware of your account being closed without notification or explanation.

I don't think anyone deserve to be humiliated this way when you pay money for a service. ASOS need to learn their lesson.

"Read this through and you will be ""impressed""","Read this through and you will be “impressed” how Asos works. I placed a big order during Black Friday sales. The order was worth 1000 euro and had in total around 55 items. Due to the fact, that you can apply promotions only with orders less than 500 pounds/euros – I had to divide it into 2 parcels, therefore I received 2 confirmations and 2 tracking references for both packages. I was e-mailed regarding delivery date, and was patiently waiting for the order. On the actual delivery date (it was Friday), I received an e-mail that 1 out of 2 packages was not delivered due to the fact that address was UNDEFINED (I received many other packages from other couriers and never had an issue), where second parcel was still on delivery way and should be expected on Monday. I started contacting Asos – they said there is nothing they can do, Asos transferred this package to delivery company and have no responsibility for it, and according to tracking information from delivery company package is going to be returned back to Asos distributor centre.  Of course I got upset, its Holiday time, Black Friday sales and presents for family. I asked them what we can do about this situation, and if it’s possible for Asos to re-send this package to me again. They said that according to their policies, that are not allowed to re-send the orders, and all they can do is provide a refund. Basically, they said that I should expect money back on my account within 14 business days, meanwhile I can add all the items to the cart again and place a new identical order – this is the only solution they provided. I said okay, I understand everything might happen in this life and let’s move forward. When I started placing new order, I realized that 20 out of 25 items that were in my order are currently OUT OF STOCK, because everything was sold out during black Friday. That was a big problem, since there were many specific items that I really needed. I also took in account, that Black Friday had 25% discount on all items, where I didn’t have that privilege anymore. Logically, I asked for the Asos representative on the phone, to at least generate a new discount code for me as it was available during black Friday. After all the frustration, I still wanted to understand their part and go forward with it. All I asked is to “put me in the same shoes” as I was when placing the order which was not delivered – this is the only fair solution. Please take in mind, if Asos provides 25% discount code, I STILL CANNOT BUY ALL DESIRED ITEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY OUT OF STOCK. Eventually, my shopping experience went fully in a wrong way. Eventually, Asos representative said that there IS NOTHING AT ALL THEY CAN HELP ME WITH. ZERO HELP WAS POVIDED. They were not willing to provide any sort of compensation…. I also explained them that I am leaving the country for Holidays, and really need my orders according to delivery date, but again there is nothing they can do…. I truly did not see any human being cooperation..Getting back to the second parcel – first parcel was not delivered and send back to Asos (on Friday), where second parcel eventually successfully arrived on Monday!!!! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??? Just to clarify. Both parcels were ordered at the same address. One parcel doesn’t get to the destination point and reason was: ADDRESS UNDEFINED, where second parcel successfully arrived 2 days after?????!!!! Where is the logic???? None of the parcels should of been delivered in this case. There you can clearly understand that it was an issue with delivery company or specifically delivery person, who simply couldn’t find the address in one day, and eventually found it 2 days later…..After receiving second parcel on Monday, I called Asos immediately to clarify how is that possible. They said they are also very impressed that this happened, and it makes no sense how first parcel was not delivered but second got the point. Eventually, they could see that its totally not my fault and it creates a big issues for me as a customer. Therefore, I asked them again what we can do about first parcel that was not delivered, since I really needed those items. Their answer was not different: there is nothing we can do – please place a new order. I asked them straight forward: 1. What about 25% discount that was available during black Friday? I don’t have that option anymore.2. And what about all the items that I purchased and are in stock anymore? Answer was typical: nothing we can do – we apologize for inconvenience. In my opinion you have more than enough power to make your customer happy and satisfied. Desire is another question. Eventually, I decided to let it go. I lost too many nerves in last couple days having all this discussions with Asos, meanwhile zero help was received. I just decided to let it go…. I’m a fighter type of person, but I realized if they are not willing to help after all my tries and effort – than I cannot make them help me. I still needed my clothing items, so I went online, chose new items (since items that I ordered before were out of stock..) and proceeded with the order. Before making the payment, I decided to call Asos again to ask regarding Premium Delivery. (Reminder: I have to go abroad for holiday and have time limitations, therefore I cannot wait for another 2 weeks for standard delivery, and had to use Express delivery). My question was next: If I am physically located in the Netherlands, but I use Asos UK region for shopping, would Premium Subscription work in this case? Asos representative who was speaking with me on the phone, asked to hold for a minute while he can discuss it with his team, when he got back he assured me for 100% that I can purchase Premium Subscription in Netherlands and use any store region from Europe to make a purchase. All European countries work in chain, and it doesn’t matter from which region you order – it will be delivered within 2 working days by Premium Delivery. I said thank you and proceeded with the order. Eventually, when I received an order confirmation it said delivery should be expected by December 20, which is 2 weeks/not 2 days - after order was placed…….. I called Asos again… Every time you call them – you speak with different person of course. What you think they said? No sorry, if you are from Netherlands you can only use Premium Delivery for Netherlands Region…. HOW THE HELL is your staff so UNPROFESSIONAL AND SO UNEDUCATED? They provide fake information to customers, who suffer from it.. Instead of helping me out with my issue, they put me in even worst situation. Eventually, I decided to never come back to Asos anymore and spread the word about this situation to others. I am waiting for my new placed orders to arrive and I will forget about Asos as a bad dream. This is the worst shopping experience in my life. I lost five days contacting Asos daily through the phone and online chat, spoke with 20-25 different representatives, where none of them provided needed help, but oppositely were providing disinformation and being rude.Couple more things from my conversations with Asos team, which “killed me” : 1. If you go to Asos.nl which is Netherlands region website, under support page they do not have CHAT option available at all. It’s simply disabled for Netherlands. I had to go to UK region, where eventually my order was placed, in order to communicate through CHAT. Ten out of twenty times, Asos representatives were not even willing to cooperate with me, and their reason was: Sorry, you are from Netherlands region, and you speak with Asos UK. We are going to transfer you to NL team where they can help you out. EVENTUALLY THEY SIMPLY CLOSE THE CHAT. There is not transfer. Employees are not even aware that NL region doesn’t have CHAT OPTION. WHO ARE THEY GOING TO TRANSFER ME TOO????? That is crazy and fully unprofessional…. They simply hang up on you and say we are going to transfer you, where nothing eventually happens and you sit and wait there like an id1ot..2. Staff is very uneducated. They tell you things which they have no clue about. PREMIUM DELIVERY information was fully wrong. Information was fake and manipulated me to do the wrong moves, where I have to suffer again. One employee says one things, another employee says completely another thing.3. Besides contacting Asos through Online Chat and Phone, I sent them 2 emails, where response should be received within max 48 hours. None of my emails were answered, its been a week. P.S. I am a good person, but I truly hate you for your service and the way you deal with customers. I will do my best letting people know what kind of service you provide especially during HOLIDAYS.","Dec 12, 2019"

And, this time they send the wrong thing again, and it's the same dress that they sent last time! It is either the provider's fault for providing the wrong dress or ASOS just displayed the wrong pictures online. They didn't even bother to double check the order before sending out!

This is a lie as both days there was always someone home.On the email it specifically said delivery will be attempted twice after failed first delivery TWO CONSECUTIVE days in a row. Yet I was told today on online chat that there will be no delivery today and instead it will be done tomorrow.I requested to cancel my order and issue a refund as I will not have any need for the order that is this late.Adviser told me he is not able to do so.I requested to raise a complaint. I was told they will pass the feedback. I was not given any reference to my complaint and adviser closed the chat without any warning.Poor. Service. Extremely disappointed","Dec 11, 2019"

In fact, the majority of my wardrobe consists of over-sized shirts from my childhood complete with copious holes and wrinkles. But my amazing girlfriend (who handles the slobbery like a champ), turned me on to ASOS.My friends are getting married. I'm a big boy. It's time to buy suits. I ordered two packages from ASOS on Black Friday. One made it to my apartment (faster than expected) while the other went missing. Upon opening the only package I actually received, I discovered that the clothes fit well. Maybe even too well. So, I was really excited about my second package but it never came. After trading multiple calls with post offices and my landlord, ASOS was there to assist me every step of the way. I reached out to them via Facebook and the response time was minimal.They proposed a solution: Initially, they agreed to reship everything I had purchased but unfortunately, the items I had bought were no longer available in my size. (I suppose my boo has good taste.)From the MIA order, ASOS is sending me one shirt and refunding me for everything else. As sad as I am to not have received my second package, I'm extremely relieved to know ASOS is good people. They saw everything through and never doubted me from the start.High marks all around, as I don't blame the delivery issues on you.","Dec 11, 2019"

Went on chat again and was told next day delivery was not possible and they advise getting a refund - details of which would be sent within 72 hours via an email. This was very disappointing, i have ordered from ASOS numerous times with no issues, i just cant understand how an order could have just been lost like that after you sending me communication saying it was 'on its way, 'dispatched' and even a delivery date.

I ordered my package on 28th of November, as I wanted to make sure it will arrive on time. However I never received email that it left the warehouse, they are not able to provide you information about the package, you have to contact with them also to get your tracking number, which clearly shows that it is this in the warehouse. If you ask them about your package before the delivery day which was on 10th of December in my case, they say wait until the 10th or wait until 17th. Once the delivery day passed and clearly your order is nowhere, they inform you to wait until 31st of December...

I spoke to a ASOS representative and they expressed that they were supposed to come as separate pieces. It was poorly advertised that; that was the case. It should not be advertised as a two piece set and if so, it should have had “items sold separately” parentheses so that it is clear to the buyer. I feel like I was tricked into buying two $40 pair of shorts that I would have never brought if that was the case. I am set to leave out of the country next week and I now I have to spend more money to replace what I thought I would have received from you guys. Overall this was a very disappointing experience and I don’t think I will be doing business with you guys again until I see improvement.

Absolute NIGHTMARE: ASOS:24277436,"It has been a full week of stress and anxiety attempting to get ASOS to fulfil their Consumer Rights commitment. I actually think my hair is falling out at this point. I have been a loyal customer of ASOS for 5 years now, both in New Zealand and in the UK. I have never had any issues until this week long saga has made me question whether ASOS really values their customers above their delivery partner, or at all, at all. I’ve spent the last week out of pocket from a missing parcel (which I replaced in good faith that your customer care team would see is an obvious case of driver fraud and refund my money) and on the phone to customer care at both ASOS and DPD.DPD have treated me like absolute trash, running a half hearted investigation into the false “safe place” request that did not come from myself, refusing to open another (after ASOS initially did not provide them with screenshots I sent on December 4th - day of delivery) cutting off my calls and denying their culpability. Last night Deniz from the ASOS customer care team agreed my case was worthy of reopening an investigation, attempted to ring DPD and was hung up on 3 times. Your colleague then suggested I go straight to my card holder as this was worthy of a refund.My card holder has now also agreed I absolutely have a case due to all the screenshots but has said the refund will need to come from ASOS and will take up to 3 weeks to process. So I am trying one last time to implore you to take away the middle man and honour my rights in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.Your customer care team have agreed I am in the right My card holder has told me I am in the right I KNOW I am in the right. I IMPLORE you to honour your contract with ME as the consumer and not just treat this like a stock standard case of DPD getting away with crappy service.If not, i will continue my case with my card holder in which I have been assured I will get my money back in due time however I ask that instead you honour my rights, value my 5 years of loyalty, believe me and refund this order or you have sadly lost a customer forever.

I had to go through customer service to get a refund. They made the refund process very easy. I only wish I was able to get the dress replaced via rush delivery instead of getting my money back.

Sent faulty items. Customer service did not fix problem. Rude and unhelpful. Avoid.,"Awful company which I recommend you boycot for their faulty items and rude customer service advisors. Been a customer for many years but customer service is so bad when there is a problem they do not care nor fix it. I ordered an item which arrvied faulty. Asos would not do anything about it just told me to send it back for an exchange. So I did. I then got refunded the item, when it was still in stock the whole time. I didn't want a refund I wanted the item ordered specifically for an event. They refused to re send it. Told me to re order. I did not wish to do this paying for delivery again. In the end I never got the bag. Asos do not care about customers and did not compensate me and offered a poor 10% off future orders which is a joke, especially so as I get that for student discount anyway, so they offered me nothing. They do not quality check items nor resolve complaints. You are better off going to primark. A few weeks prior I ordered some earrings which arrvied broken. They were refunded without issue but there was no apology and the bag was never replaced. 2 faulty items in a row. Disgraceful. Highly disappointed from assos.","Dec 10, 2019"

Used to be fantastic! Massively gone downhill...,"I always used to shop at ASOS - Infact, I have probable spent thousands of pounds with them in the past. Not just because I thought they had well priced clothes, but also because the customer service used to be fantastic. Any issue used to be dealt with with the customers best interest at heart, they were loyal to their customers, and in return customers were generally loyal back.Lately, I have had a few issues, and all of them have been dealt with appallingly.1. I ordered a jumper which took around 3 weeks to come. This was only after I made endless phone calls to DPD, ASOS customer service, along with messages on their Facebook messenger. They told me that they needed to wait 5 working days for DPD to respond. Another wasted week. Eventually the jumper came, but I wonder if it would have ever showed up had I not spent realistically over an hour of my life making calls and sending messages.2. The same jumper was too big, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement. Again, I heard nothing for about 2 weeks, so yet again I got in touch with ASOS customer services. Arbz basically told me that the issue was no longer their responsibility and they were not sending out another jumper, as they haven’t received mine.Unfortunately, I stupidly mis placed my proof of postage, so am unable to prove that I actually sent it back. My word is simply not good enough after many years of being a loyal customer and several thousands of pounds later.3. Why are ASOS no longer rewarding their loyal customers? I understand that they are in a bad place financially (high turnovers, low profits/non-existent profits), and will likely need a bail out in the foreseeable future. However, cutting money by offering poor customer service = bad retention, and ultimately means less turnover. Come on ASOS! How about you remember how to properly look after your customers and begin to focus on what really matters to your business again!","Dec 10, 2019"

This order has brought me no end of…,"This order has brought me no end of hassle. It was supposed to be a next day delivery, after placing my order I was told it would arrive on Sunday (not saturday). I appriciate that I may have missed the cut off deadline, and was happy to recieve a dispatch notice on saturday night, say it would be delivered on sunday. Sunday however, my parcel did not arrive, so on Monday I got in touch via live chat to a member of staff called Paige. I explained that my works do was that day (monday), that my parcel was missing with my outfits in, and that I had no idea when I was to expect them. I was told I would have to wait until the 12th. Which was 5 days over due. I explained I wanted to complain, and escalate this issue, but was told there was no way to do so, and that the live chat would be used to take feedback on board. I asked to be notified with a follow up regarding my complaint, and was told that wasn't possible. I was told there was no contact details for complaints, no form and no way to highlight my issues other than in my live chat with Paige.Today,  I arrived home to a note from hermes saying that they had tried to deliver my parcel, it was the last attempt and that I would have to get back in touch with the seller. Which I did this evening. I was on live chat with Lisa (refrence for chat: 24411465) for nearly an hour. The collegue I spoke to repeatedly ignored what I was trying to explain in my messages, and just continued to repeat that hermes will try and deliver tomorrow, and if they don't I am to get in touch.I asked several times if I could just cancel the order, as that is what had happened last time my bridesmaid dresses had gone missing in September. I was told no. I asked for a complaints contact link, as this issue has cause me so much stress. This time I was sent the relevant link to highlight my concerns. I've been told that I now have to wait to see if hermes will deliver tomorrow, if not I'm to get in touch again. I would implore you to encourage your staff to know company policies eg links to a feedback form, contact details and a customers right to highlight concerns and issues. I have now had several isses with asos, and each time I try and believe its an anomaly. On other occasions ASOS staff have been so helpful, however this time, I just felt like I was pushed from pillar to post, and lied to repeatedly. My parcel still isn't here, and it's now down to me to try and chase it up and resolve it, as I've had little to no customer support.","Updated Dec 10, 2019"

It would have been confusing for her as I had already spoken to another staff member (twice) on chat previously about this (which I gave her the ref # for) but she quickly understood what was going on and resolved it for me.  I am really happy with the chat customer service option, makes it so much easier than calling or emailing and waiting for a response.

Being quite a large order, I was concerned that I would be charged for the order and being close to Christmas, that would have been a nightmare! I spoke to the lovely Tayyibah on Asos live chat this morning and within minutes, my refund had issue had been resolved and my Klarna account had been settled. Excellent, friendly and efficiant service and gave me the peace of mind that if i have an issue that it can be sorted with no issues. Thank you Asos!","Dec 10, 2019"

They told me I would have a refund in 10 days but here we are day 9 and still no refund . They suggested re ordering the product if I still wanted it but I found  the risk of losing more money that I paid upfront unacceptable so I went to Zara and bought a beautiful jumper there .....still no refund from Assos","Dec 10, 2019"

Order never received.My work colleagues ordered me a birthday gift in a black Friday offer, however I never received it. First, despite me paying for a next day delivery subscription - the parcel was scheduled to be dispatched 2 weeks after the order was placed. This makes me think Asos is selling goods they dont have in stock.My parcel was then marked as ""dispatched"" - but there was never any attempt to deliver it and it was ""sent back and refunded"".Half of the products on order are now out of stock, the other half are obviously full price.I had numerous chats with customer service, who were ""at a loss"" with what happened, and despite my pleas not to cancel my order and redeliver, nobody got in touch with me since.Nice little scam for Asos- who are obviously struggling with cash flow, to bump up their sales for Black Frdiay with investors.","Dec 10, 2019"

RUN!!!!!,"ASOS is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. I ordered two pairs of shoes on Black Friday because of an amazing deal. I received my package fast but they sent the wrong size shoes! I immediately contacted them and they didn't seem to care at all. They just said send them back. I planned on it but I asked if they do an exchange and they said no, that you have to repurchase the items if you want them before they issue you a refund. I said fine whatever...since your company made the mistake can I have a coupon code to get the shoes at the same price I originally paid? The said a ""special department"" does the coupons and that they would review it and send me one but it would take 24-48 hours....how fricken ridiculous that the customer service agent couldn't just give me one since they screwed up. I ANXIOUSLY waited for them to contact me to give me the coupon code because both pairs of shoes are limited stock in the size I was supposed to receive originally. I was emailed by them today that they will not be giving me a coupon code until the shoes are returned to them which can take up to 10 days according to them. 10 DAYS!!!!! I'm scared to death that the shoes will be sold out by then and all because ASOS doesn't care about their customers at all. These were meant to be Christmas presents and because of how they're being I doubt I will even be able to get the shoes at all. I am absolutely appalled that they treat their customers like this, I only tried them because I've seen YT influencers shop with them often and recommend them. I am WARNING everyone  I know to run, do not order from them, they screw up and don't care. They just want your money and expect you to spend more money to fix their mistakes. I was originally upset they just wouldn't do an exchange but fine whatever I got over it and just said give me a coupon code so I can hurry up and order the shoes before they're sold out, but they essentially said F U. Please please please do not shop with this company. BEWARE!!!!!","Dec 10, 2019"

slow delivery. Useless discount codes.,"ASOS can no longer get an item to me in 3-5 days it sometimes takes more like 8-10 days. I used to rely on ASOS for fast delivery.Also, they recently had separate discount codes for saving. If you spent over £80 you could use ‘COSY10’ to save £10, ‘COSY20’ to save £20 on a certain order value & ‘COSY30’ to save £30 on orders over £180 or something similar. I spent enough to use ‘COSY30’ but returned some items but they would not reapply the relevant code based on my final order value. Seems like a ridiculous way to offer a discount & they should have honoured the new code.","Dec 9, 2019"

Customer satisfaction isn't their priority,"Hasan was very pleasant but he of course had to adhere to asos regulations which weren't very flexible. I made two very reasonable suggestions on how they could resolve my issue. Briefly this was: their delays meant the recipient will have left the country before that time came. I couldn't alter delivery address even though they'd not yet prepared the package. I could order again and send the original package back upon arrival but it had gone up in price and they wouldn't honour the original price paid.Bit of a shame as I assumed asos would be more like amazon in that they clearly value the customer over everything, even if they take a bit of a hit but sadly not.","Dec 9, 2019"

Both Support representatives I've…,"Both Support representatives I've spoken with, were really polite and willing to help. But for resolving my problem I had to contact you too many times because of your returns policy on incorrect items. First of all I had to wait many days for receiving my item and after realising you have sent me an incorrect item, I had to contact you 4-5 times to get everything done.  For those cases you need to review your policy, if you actually care for customer satisfaction.  Now you are making the Customer spend time and money for ""fixing"" your fault.  The customer needs to place a new order, pay for it, create a new returns form, pay for it and go to the post-office to send you back the incorrect item and wait for approximately a month for receiving a refund.  This is not acceptable for something that is your fault.","Dec 9, 2019"

I searched several wedding dress shops for $1,000+ dresses and didn’t find one I liked as much as the Asos one. The size finder is great and all five I ordered fit perfectly.

Customer service on Twitter is slow and deliver is rubbish,"Customer service on Twitter is the slowest I have experience for any company!Delivery is SHAMBLES! I ordered 9 items using my next day delivery on Wednesday 4th December at 7am. The items did not come the next day (Thursday 5th December).3 of my 9 items then arrived on Friday 6th December at 4:50pm. I called Asos customer services who said they would get the other items sent out to me and they would be with my by Sunday 8th December at the latest (she even said on the phone they could come on Saturday 7th December! but more likely Sunday). I asked the lady to change the delivery address to my home address as it was currently set to be sent to my work address which I am at on Monday to Friday. I then received an email today at 3am to say 3 of the 6 remaining items would be with me on Monday 9th December. The other 3 items are now out of stock (they weren’t when I ordered them!).I called Asos customer services again to ask why they are coming to me on Monday 9th December as I was told on the phone they would come today.The lady then tells me the 3 items in stock will be with you on Tuesday 10th December, not Monday 9th December like the email says! I also explained I will not be home in the week so to change the delivery address, however you are unable to change the delivery address back to my work address now?! I cannot believe this. You should be embarrassed.  I understand slow delivery and I could have handled all my orders arriving on Friday 6th December... or even today. But to now say it will be with me on Tuesday 10th December at the very earliest and that it could even take as long as the 16th December is ridiculous!Some advice - don’t use Hermes if they are being slow. It doesn’t make you look good at all.","Dec 8, 2019"

In short: the customer service is terrible, delivery never attempt and tracker useless, supposed to be a next day delivery 8 days later still waiting! They refuse to allow me to place a new order (the parcel is in transit somewhere) at the sale price. the customer advisors cut the chat 3x on me!!!They are useless, gestion is terrible, they don't reply. Everything is made to build frustration. They send you copy/past that are not relevant. It's an international company, well known and having funds but they can't even put a bit of money on customer care issues, RIDICULOUS. WORSTE EVER If you want the full story:My order has been placed to be sent in the evening, the courier never came. In the email I've received it's stating they attempt 2 delivery before sending the parcel back to the sender; Tracker not updated for 3 days (I've paid £8 for a next day delivery) and here is the nightmare of the customer care beginning:You can't call the service so you get this choices:-  messenger text with automatised reply - useless and no one will reply don't waist your time- email - no reply- text chat I've been in contact with 5 different persons through the chats, and it just got worst and worst;First one is asking me to wait at least one day (so a next day delivery not received and a tracker not update for 3 days is not sufficient), ok then I'll wait!Second person, is sending me copy/past of random things I already know, I've been trying to explain to her for 20 min that I'm asking for my order to be re-issued and she CLOSE the chat on me and send me an email stating I'll be refunded!I reply straight away asking to not refund but to re-issue the order (sale order) no reply;Go back on a chat get no one replying for 15 minutes and then get cut out;AGAIN on the chat end up with a person telling my order is already in Warehouse (which is not) and they can't do anything. I ask to place a new order with the same price and they refuse without any reason. Get the chat CUT ON ME AGAIN.On the chat again - what a joke -, same b*llsh*t again!!! Send a screenshot showing they should attempt to deliver twice, the person reply ""your email doesn't show your order"", LOL that's your templates go and ask you marketing team to change this!!! They say my order is at the Warehouse - which is not and I will be refunded in 7 day, but then the opposite it's still in transit and will be refunded once received. I'm losing my patience and now only copy past just as they do, over and over again - might takes me a few years before I get someone competent.Go back on the chat and get some one sending me the same things over and over again.They don't even read what you asking, they don't even know what they are doing!","Updated Dec 8, 2019"

faulty item,"I have recently ordered a men’s onesie which was meant to be a Christmas present, upon arriving and after checking this item I can see there was a rip in the arm.

Parcel delivery,I ordered a parcel for an event on 7th December. I ordered it to be delivered on the 3rd. There was a problem with delivery (Hermes) so it was sent back. They say they will try to deliver up to 3 times after that. Nothing. All week. The event comes and I have nothing as that parcel was for the 7th. I try and contact ASOS all week and get nothing back. I finally get the online chat working and someone called Talia speaks to me. They help me out but say I have to wait until the 9th to get a full refund on my parcel because of the contract they have with Hermes. The outfit I ordered was specifically for the event on the 7th and could not go because I did not have my parcel. Hermes say they will try and deliver it up to 3 times but no attempt to delivery was made but yet I still have to wait until the 9th to get a full refund. Not happy. I use ASOS all the time and this is the worst experience I have had with them. I like ASOS hence the 3 stars and Talias help otherwise it would have been less.,"Dec 8, 2019"

Utterly farcical,"Utterly farcical, waited 5 days longer than the specified delivery day which I paid extra to have, after spending 2hrs+ over 3 separate occasions, finally found out that the delivery never even left the warehouse. Received unintended emails asking me to return the delivery I never received, was told I couldn't get the refund for the premier delivery service at the same time as the refund for my clothes,because a specialist team need to process it! Then the advisor dropped the chat window without resolving everything. This is a disgrace of a business on all fronts and I have absolutely no intention of going anywhere near them again. I'm only hoping they don't mess up the refund of the delivery charge, and I need to go through the only terrible channels of communication they offer.","Dec 7, 2019"
Terrible operations and service,"Terrible service. Lost my return package. Apparently It's a well known problem that they loose packages all the time, Unfortunately I didn't know that and this time I forgot to retain the evidence. You would think that they would document the return label that they include with your order in the event that it gets lost but nope they have no clue!   It's really put me off shopping on there again. It's always better to shop at brands who value you not put you out of pocket for over £100. It might be a small amount to them but its not to the average customer.","Dec 7, 2019"

Worst company I have ever dealt with - Read up on your comsumer rights before using them,"Worst company I have ever dealt with. Used to order from them a lot a few years ago but stopped after getting fed up with delivery problems and being sent an expensive wool jumper which had clearly been shrunk in the wash. Customer service were a nightmare to deal with and they never refunded return postage for faulty products. The company was more hassle than they were worth.A few years later and I decided to order a christmas present for a family member from them on black friday. Big mistake. They took payment and dispatched the order. However, the order has been marked as delivered despite no attempted delivery to the address specified on the order, no correspondance from the courier (fastway) and no indication as to where the parcel was left. This has happened purely because they have chosen to use the worst courier company available. Anyway, I emailed them 3 days ago expalining the situation and asking for the order to be delivered to the correct address or for a refund. They haven't even bothered to reply and there's not even a phone number for customer service. I'm now left without my order despite having being charged and these guys don't even have the courtesy to reply to my emails. Save yourself the hassle everyone. I won't be ordering from ASOS again.At this point, I'll now either have to decide whether to get paypal to action a chargeback or take them to small claims court for the money they have taken from me. Honestly, I don't know how so many people use this company. Their prices aren't cheap ( generally you can find same products cheaper elsewhere unless on sale). Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They use the delivery company (fastway couriers) with the worst reputation and they ignore consumer law.","Dec 7, 2019"

However I had to attend a swish wedding so checked out all the sites. Asos is definitely the best in my humble opinion. I like all their brands, but I LOVE the ASOS brand..in terms of being incredibly chic, the colours, style and even the photography and poses of the models are better...other fashion sites seem really tacky by comparison. And the asos website is simple and clear in terms of graphics and text,, and easy to use. And affordable, especially with Afterpay. All my orders have arrived without a problem from the UK, and more quickly than sending a parcel from Tasmania to Sydney..I know this sounds gushy but I am absolutely thrilled to have discovered asos and won't bother shopping anywhere else, online or instore.","Dec 7, 2019"

Problem with the delivery,"I was waiting for my parcel to come on on Friday, has ordered several things, the price was fair, and the number of goods I could select from was decent as well. Everything was good except for one thing, which has spoiled everything.So basically delivery must have come to the UPS access point, from which I would take my clothing. When I have checked where is my order, it was written that it is being returned to the ASOS! I was highly frustrated and disappointed and decided to in deep and analyze why it wasn't delivered and basically it was written that UPS station refused to take my order! I was shocked. Was calling UPS, no answer. Reached to the ASOS support, and they told me that my order is going to be refunded in 10 days...... I simply lost control, as I am leaving in 9days from the UK and needed this clothing urgently.I am very disappointed that I should order this clothing again, but at first wait for a refund, then try to catch my size in stock and then again wait for the order to come.

It is christmas time and people are ordering gifts and travelling, and I have now run out of time to organise new gifts for my family.

So I add 4 little things and it's done.Now, today, the 6th of December, a damn week later, I get an email saying ""oops, actually we don't have the ones we said we did have, here is the money you paid for them"".So now I get back the money paid for the shoes, but now I wasted Black Friday trusting this company, will have to buy the same shoes at a more expensive price because they can't manage their stock and I now I still paid for 4 other products that I would not have bought if not for the shoes. Ridiculous.At least ask if I want to wait until they get back in stock or if i want to cancel my entire order, not just nitpick your mistakes away and the client harmed in the process.Terrible decision making behind this.","Dec 7, 2019"

Frustrated with No show order and business process.,"I tried using the chat application to talk to someone. But they didn't have any answers for me. Situation: I haven't recieved my package yet and after talking to FedEx, they advised that there's a note on my tracking that states that the box they received is empty. There's no contents in it. They advised to talk to you guys but your customer service rep advised that he doesn't have the answers at the moment. Your customer service rep was trying to contact FedEx  and advised to me that it will take 2 business days to get an answer back. I just called FedEx today and they gave me the answers I needed .  FedEx was great in getting the answer for me right away. I'm not sure why you guys need 2 business days to get a response from FedEx. It sounds like the business process is flawed when a customer can get an answer faster than a customer service rep.  I'm going to wait the 2 business days and see what the response is. Either way, It looks like It'll be 2 months before I even received my order which I paid extra for to get it shipped faster.","Dec 7, 2019"

"Lost Parcel, Horrific Communication & ZERO empathy","After raising a concern about the failure to deliver my parcel 4days after next day delivery was guaranteed, and no updates provided I reached out to ASOS and DPD. DPD finally informed me after I reached out twice that my parcel had been lost but all updates on the investigation would be sent to ASOS. ASOSs response (at 5days after the item was supposed to be delivered) was for me to reach our again because they weren’t sure what was happening right now and completely ignored my request for a new version of the parcel to be sent, with the sign off ‘hope this helps’ - the irony was not lost on me as ASOS have quite literally done absolutely nothing to help.","Dec 6, 2019"

Shocking,Shocking. Twitter dm's aren't replied to unless you tweet them directly as well which makes the whole thing pointless and even if they do reply they don't say anything helpful.

After being told to go back and forth between the two several times, ASOS finally told him he had to wait until the 10th before they could either start the refund process or resend his items. The jacket is said to be low in stock yet there’s “nothing they can do” for five more days? It’s not his fault his item was stolen. I’ve dealt with several other clothing companies who do whatever they can to solve your problem ASAP. This customer service is a joke.

Alison was super helpful and amazing. I ordered my items on Cyber Monday with the premier delivery which I needed for Friday, obviously I know it might take longer than a couple of days so I patiently waited. It is now Thursday and DPD have said that my items are being sent back to ASOS and I just wanted to know why. One item size was out of stock of the size I chose and are now out of sale but Alison managed to honor the sale prices to me, which was extremely kind. 5* for Alison.Elise, however, was extremely unhelpful, rude and just closed the chat when I asked why my order had been sent back. I wasn't being rude, she just wasn't giving me any answers which Alison managed to give me. She also told me the only way I can get my items are to reorder with the out of sale prices...? Why on earth would I do that when this whole thing has been completely out of my power? She said she wasn't able to do anything about it, to just ""reorder my items if I want them"" and then just shut the conversation. All I wanted was to know why my items were being sent back. I'm a loyal customer of ASOS, and to be spoken to and treated like that is totally unacceptable. Thankfully Alison managed to make it a lot better for me.-5* for you, Elise.","Dec 5, 2019"

And now, I have been waiting for more than a month to be reimbursed but my parcel is still at the warehouse and God knows why, no one pick it up so that I can have my money back !!

"So bad, never exchange","So bad, it hurts. I ordered shoes, and received an item that was different to the picture of what I ordered. Customer services were reluctant to admit they had made a mistake and informed me asos do not allow for complaints to be made. So I had no choice but to follow the standard returns process. I asked for an item exchange as I want the shoes and returned the wrong item on 19/11/2019. I heard nothing for weeks so asked customer services what is going on, to then be told my return had been lost in transit. The support agent apologised and booked an order to be sent out next day, and to look out for an email confirming this. I receive the email, to my shock, it says I've been refunded. Not what the agent said and not what I wanted. Though I'm not surprised, they made so many mistakes.","Dec 5, 2019"

Now this order has now been “delivered” to whom I have no idea. Asos refuse to compensate me or even give me my money back and tbh it’s taken almost a week for basically nothing to happen and conversation with generic answers from ASOS.

And this time after 7 days from shipment I decided to search for help. Turns out dress is lost.. Great, left me with 3days to find new outfit.I'm pretty new and bought few items but I don't know sizing or quality from pictures, I return few items. Then Asos decides to tell me that my account is now flagged for high returns volume... Seriously?!  What a poor experience. I will think twice before I order again.","Dec 5, 2019"
Premier delivery? Only when it suits,I pay for premier delivery so I can have my order the next day or on a day I know I’ll be home. This is why I pay for it. Yet ASOS during busy periods can just switch it off and make me wait up to 10 days for my order. When they switch it back on they then can not expedite my order even though I could order it again today and receive it tomorrow. Zero customer service and clearly premier delivery is a rip off.

Worst Customer Service,"After my package went missing I contacted ASOS for assistance, like FedEx requested me to do. ASOS told me to wait two week to see if it showed up, nothing came. Contacted them again told me to wait another week, still nothing came. Contacted them a third time told me to wait another week. At this point it seemed a bit ridiculous that I had to wait over a month to get an actual resolution to the problem. I asked for them the send me a replacement order, that they said they would overnight. The package did not get it overnighted. Instead just got the run around by customer service, with them having to confirm my address multiple different times with multiple different people. In the end I did not end up getting my order because they ran out of stock of EVERY item I purchased. If they just would have resolved the problem it earlier they would have kept a long time customer.","Dec 4, 2019"

Seriously don't shop here !!!!!!,"I am extremely disappointed with the service from this company and would highly recommend anyone using this site to think twice about shopping with them !I live in the uk, I have placed 4 orders in total and only 1 of those arrived as paid for as for the other 3 first was placed as a single order though I only recieved 1 of the 4 garments ordered as a single order. When I contacted the company through their online chat I waited almost half hour before connecting with anyone and was informed they had no idea why this happened but they did request those items to be re ordering and sent so at least they did sort this out quickly!Then I placed another order 2 weeks later, buying 3 items though ordered 2 separately but both within 10 mins of each other paying for next day, this was on a Friday.On the Saturday  ( next day ) I only recieved the first order and the second one with the 2 items didn't arrive, made contact again waiting a long time before getting through and was told I'd have to wait till Monday, in Monday still nothing waited again to get through on their online chat and was informed I had to wait till Tuesday, Tues came and still nothing, again waited to connect and was informed it could now be passed to their specialist team to investigate. I received one email to inform me the specialist tem now had my query and would get back to me shortly but if I had anymore questions or concerns this person would be happy to help, that was Tuesday morning, now Wednesday and I've still heard Nothing, I sent an email to the person saying he would be happy to help and he hasn't responded, I've gone back to the site to use the online chat only to find this is no longer an option  !My order comes to the value of £154 and yet they have done absolutely Nothing to resolve it. I can't speak to anyone and they continue to advertise these items for sale so I don't understand why I am having such issues !I would seriously suggest that anyone thinking of buying from Asos look elsewhere  !","Dec 4, 2019"
Do not order if you live in Canada,"Do not order if you live in Canada! Worst customer service. On top of the item amount you have to pay customs. If it doesn’t fit, you have to PAY to return.

IF I COULD GIVE ASOS ZERO STARS I…,"IF I COULD GIVE ASOS ZERO STARS I would. If you are ordering from asos, forget about customer service. I’ve been ordering from them for years now and they could simply careless about their customers. I’ve had two incidents with ASOS. The first time I thought was just bad luck but after this time , I will never shop on ASOS again or recommend it to anyone. First experience involved me sending it to another address that was not convenient to me, I notified ASOS and they said it was too late so I go and pick it up from the address and low and behold IT WAS NOT THERE. I told ASOS someone took my package , but instead of offering me a replacement package, they told me I need to notify the police. And what about the money I spent ASOS? Nope they don’t care. Second incident is that they send me an item that’s faulty and they sent the wrong size. When I asked them for some sort of compensation, Tara kept insisting that I return the package. The item is out of stock so returning the package means I would lose the item. I liked the shoes and would have been okay keeping them if I wasn’t paying full price for them. I tried to explain that to her and she stated the only way I could get my money back is by returning the item. I then asked to speak to a manager to which she stated she “couldn’t do” because they have protocols they need to handle and then rudely ended the chat on me . Even shein refunded me when their item was faulty . Waste of money. I rather just buy the items from the companies themselves than support an industry with no customer service.","Dec 4, 2019"

ASOS ripping customers off as usual,"Sadly incredibly poor service from ASOS and still no resolution. I renewed and paid for my ASOS Premier on 11th Nov but it hasn’t seemed to register on the site so when I went to place an order with the Black Friday discounts it refused to offer me free Premier Delivery and wanted to charge me £5.95 for next day delivery. Despite chasing ASOS repeatedly to question what happened, everything was selling out. After having their iT team look into it, it started working yesterday - Tuesday. When everything I wanted was out of stock. How very convenient. I am now incredibly disappointed to see you’ve started charging me from the day I ordered it despite not being able to use it. I asked for the start date to be amended to yesterday and not the 11th Nov as it’s an error with the company that I haven’t been able to do so. I was told they couldn’t do this for ‘legal and security reasons’ which doesn’t make any sense. I am fuming and will be taking this further.","Dec 4, 2019"

ASOS has been my favorite company for…,"ASOS has been my favorite company for years due to free fast shipping, easy returns, great product, and great service. Recent changes to United States operations have been abysmal, unfortunately, and I would no longer recommend supporting the company in the US due to the following reasons:1) USPS shipping was suddenly and secretly removed for returns. Customers could choose between UPS and the convenience of a USPS home pickup. Suddenly, only UPS is available. When talking to customer service, I was told to walk 30 minutes to a UPS drop-off location with my return.2) Orders arrive by inconsistent carriers and are frequently delayed.3) The ""What's new"" assortment is no longer relevant for US shoppers. It is a mess of random product and not the assortment that UK users see.4) Quality of product has declined. I don't know who is responsible for operations in Georgia, but it has been messy and disappointing. I'm hoping to give ASOS another chance given their amazing extended sizing, but they will no longer be my go-to fashion destination and I worry for their future as a company. I wholeheartedly recommend ASOS for customers in the UK, but the US experience is disappointing.","Dec 4, 2019"

No adequate answer given apart from a pre-written message stating ""For order number XXXXXXX I can see you were refunded XXX GBP on the X December 2019. Please allow 10 working days for the funds to appear in your account.""I asked for clarification, and was told that if I wanted the items I would have to re-order (not possible since 90% of the items are now out of stock). Some back and forth with the rep and I was advised ""If you have any further questions please visit our help pages"", the chat was closed as I continued to type.Still £300 down and awaiting a refund for an order I never received.

Awful customer service,"I am absolutely fuming! After waiting for five minutes for the initial reply, with me asking for some indication that anyone was even there to help me, Alexandru finally replied asking me to wait while he had a look into my order. I waited a further 10 minutes for him to come back to which he said that Asos has had to increase delivery times with no advice on what I can do next as I already knew this!! My initial message told you that I noticed in my confirmation email of my order that the standard delivery times had drastically increased from the usual 3 days to over a week. My issue is that I need my items this week for an event and that I feel misled as the website was wholly unclear prior to confirming the order that the new standard delivery was a date pulled at random in the distant future. After reading over his reply, I began typing my response and he sent an additional message to say that as I have not replied he is going to end the conversation, which is ridiculous as I know he can see me typing and it had only been two minutes!! So I started to type faster hoping to send it but he ended the chat immediately!! I am absolutely livid at the lack of respect, I would have just accepted a simple apology initially once I received the information I needed but now I am furious over the awful customer service experience. I'm so shocked that such a reputable company like Asos has disappointed me so much in what should have been such a simple conversation.","Dec 3, 2019"

"ASOS - No regard for peoples time, money or environment",ASOS is not able to fulfil their orders in the time frame stated! I placed an order on Friday and even though I have next day delivery it said the estimated delivery date would be the 4th of December. I got an email saying they where extremely busy and I would receive an email confirmation in a few hours. When I received the confirmation approx 8 hours later the delivery address was pushed to the 11th of December. I immediately tried to cancel but I was unable to as it was outside the hour period. I needed to cancel or amend the address as I am moving to France on the 5th of December.I have been told that I cannot cancel or amend the address even though it’s not being dispatched for 10 days. And it’s an error on their end as they are not fulfilling the orders in the time they stated. What Asos have suggested is no 1 that I illegally access the property I am vacating - even though I have said on a number of occasions that I will be in a different country.The 2nd suggestion which disgusts me is that they are willing to let the order me packaged. Then sent to a currier for delivery - once the currier attempts a number of times it will then be returned to Asos. If the order is returned to Asos they will then process a refund. I am disgusted at how much of a waste of time and money this is. Not to mention the affect this will have on the environment if this is their solution to this issue. It is also a waste of my money and they have no regard that the order may go missing.I will be boycotting Asos until they find a way to be more sustainable. Or show come care towards their workers and they environment. Absolute disgrace!,"Dec 2, 2019"

"ASOS very good value, selection and customer service. Shame about the delivery company","ASOS have been very good with prices, selection, dispatching orders and handling returns. The customer service is excellent. Unfortunately it is the delivery company they use in my area, Hermes, which continually disappoints (missing and late deliveries!). DPD used to deliver in the past and were always on time. This is the only area that needs rectifying.","Dec 2, 2019"

Extremely unhappy with ASOS,"Extremely unhappy with the service ASOS have provided and I am a very disappointed customer! Firstly I initially wasn’t aware or even made aware that my order had been cancelled last Thursday !!! After having waited in for the order with no luck I logged in to my account to find it had been cancelled! I find it insulting after contacting ASOS that they indicated this was because of my payment as this was NOT anything to do with my payment details as I had since used the saved payment details on their site. I believe it was because ASOS simply can not deal with the demand of customers ordering on the deals you have offered on Black Friday ! And then don’t even bother to let the customer know! Secondly, not only were some of the items now out of stock which again, was not my fault as I had correctly ordered them on Thursday, I then find it very disappointing that when having to re-order these items I can not even get them on next day delivery, despite having paid for the premier delivery service! I would not be recommending the premier delivery service to anyone in future and will also happily explain how you have failed in this area and take it further! I am very unhappy about this and would like to log a formal complaint with the way in which this order was dealt with. Poor customer service from a big company! A very unhappy customer and unprofessional service!","Dec 2, 2019"

It would have been faster for me to place my orders the following Monday than it will be for the orders I placed last Thursday and Friday...not very impressed by this!","Dec 2, 2019"

ASOS live chat with the very unhelpful John,"I needed help with an order, as one order would be delivered on my paid for next day premier delivery on the correct date, and the other order wouldn’t be delivered until 10 days later as ASOS had put it through as standard delivery! I go online to chat with someone to help, and John was the most unhelpful ASOS chat worker I have ever come across. There was nothing he was willing to do to help, and wasn’t even able to explain to me why this mistake has been made. My order was for items totalling over £400, so to have to wait so long for this to arrive is just ridiculous! I cannot cancel my order, I cannot get it sent with my other order to come at the same time, so ASOS, thank you for being so unhelpful!","Dec 2, 2019"

Hermes lied and said they tried to deliver when they clearly didn’t as I was at home and also have CCTV. I now have to wait a week to allow them time to deliver my next day delivery. Go figure!!

When and contacted customer care I was taken care by Kirsteen. This person states that the order was placed in standard delivery so she wasn't going to issue the refund. I place three order that day and only that didn't go through with regards to the free delivery. I asked for at least a voucher to cover that fee as you can see that it was a mistake and I was going to place more order. This person wouldn't listen to what I was saying and closed the chat. This is an horrible customer service. I work in customer service myself and I don't understand this behaviour toward a customer.,"Dec 2, 2019"

The address I put down was my office address, and I also ticked the option to leave the parcel at a safe space just in case the whole office called a sickie. Anyway, after trying multiple times to contact ASOS, I received a mail from them saying that I have to wait till they receive the parcel back n then they would issue a refund. This process should be done by 2nd December at the latest. And here we are. Nothing from them, no communication. And despite of my multiple tries to use their ""Chat now"" option, it NEVER works!!

No one wants to look less than their best on their wedding day. There was a little mixup with my order and my return, but in the end I got the most perfect dress I loved and returned the ones that didn't work out. ASOS was so nice about the whole thing and they even gave me my dress I wore that day for free as a wedding present to keep, which was a total surprise! I feel so lucky that I got my most perfect dress, from a company I truly love. My special day was just made even more special. I'll definitely shop with ASOS again and again.","Dec 2, 2019"

They think they’re above consumer law,"I have shopped with ASOS for years, they have always been my first point of call if I ever want to buy anything online. I’ve never had ANY issues with them until this year.I placed 3 orders using Klarna, all of which sadly included either faulty/incorrect items. I’ve been unwell so my return was late, only by a few days, however it did not even cross my mind that this would be an issue since my orders were incorrect/faulty.ASOS have issued gift vouchers for the orders- when I raised my concern I was told that it would be passed to a “specialist team”. Almost a week later I had to chase them for a response, to which I was told “these orders will be refunded by 5th December”. I thought that the issue was resolved.The next day I was told that the previous person informed me incorrectly and that NO refunds are being issued.Consumer rights act 2015 states that BY LAW a customer can return incorrect/faulty orders, or items that are generally not fit for purpose within 6 months of receiving them. ASOS appear to be convinced that they are above consumer law and almost 2 weeks on they are still trying to bully me into backing down. It’s shocking to think how many customers they have done this to who probably have backed down because they’ve not been aware of their rights. ASOS are fraudulent bullies and I can assure you that I will NOT be backing down.","Dec 2, 2019"

Refused to Give Me My Refund Back,"I had to return two items, because the sizes were incorrect. After I returned both, I was only given credit for one and ASOS refused to give me credit for the other item that I returned, because a promo code was applied at checkout. Basically, after I returned two items, the total amount that I spent dropped below the minimum ($250) required for me to use the promo code. While I understand the reasoning, I'd say that most of the stores would have refunded the amount as credit, but ASOS did not. Not the smartest thing to do when trying to grow clientele. I will highly recommend ASOS to consider giving refunds to customers even after they return items after using the promo codes, as most stores do, especially because customers will only know whether the size was correct after trying them on and I feel that I am being punished for doing so here.","Updated Dec 2, 2019"

This means my parcel has to be delivered to me, and then Delivered back to them, all because they can’t be bothered to cancel the order, ‘because it has already been packed’, it’s disgusting that a company of that size does not have capacity to look through orders and not deliver the ones which are not needed. All in the hope that the consumer forgets to return the item, and they make money. I will never shop with ASOS again, and I will always deter my friends from using them.

Not good enough,"Unfortunately, customer service is not polite at all... Solutions are slow to be found or never found. I am honestly disappointed.

Issue resolved quickly,"This is the second time I have had to deal with ASOS for a problem with their couriers. ASOS have been great in dealing with my problem. Quick and efficient in dealing with my request. I had to wait for 30 minutes to speak to someone using thier online chat service but this may be because it was Black Friday weekend. Despite this issue, I will use them again.","Dec 2, 2019"
Disappointed with material quality!,I bought what I thought an amazing jumpsuit to celebrate mine and my boyfriends birthday.I paid £40 and the material used was not what I was excepted at all... my jumpsuit completely ripped on the bus! This was extremely humiliating and ruined my mood.The quality of the product was extremely poor. I'm very upset has I waited a month to used this product on this special occasion.Patricia Horta,"Dec 2, 2019"
Ordered something black Friday as a…,"Ordered something black Friday as a replacement since the original order I made the day before was a shambles! I received an item that didn't even have tags and seemed worn, but the worst of it I received a NON-ASOS item which was a ragged dirty stained stinking Ralph Lauren polo which someone has obviously sent out instead of what I ordered. I contacted ASOS who didn't have a care in the world about how they had sent me someone's dirty top and didn't offer to help fix the situation considering the top I actually ordered was now out of stock and it would be unlikely that I could buy it again at the Black Friday price. Good luck to you if you ever have an issue as you will receive automated generic responses from people who aren't interested at all. The shock of receiving someone's perfectly folded tissue wrapped old manky t-shirt shows it must have been someone who works there! Either that or they just send orders out in the dark!!!","Dec 2, 2019"

£10 per year for a fortnights wait,"Usually great service but placed an order on Black Friday and the delivery date is 11th December, despite paying £10 a year for premium delivery (why bother!). In the T&C’s they’ve covered themselves in case of this so I have no comeback, but yesterday the premium delivery was back up and running- which means that an order placed yesterday/today will be prioritised delivery wise over mine, which is so irritating!","Dec 2, 2019"
Premier Customer... Premier Badly Handled!,"I ordered two parcels a week and a bit ago with my premier delivery as I always do - usually little to no problems - this time, didn’t turn up. Was obviously not impatient enough to deal with it immediately, but a few days in and still no parcels I was irked. Was told when I contacted ASOS that this couldn’t be dealt with until a week later - why? No explanation given. As a premier customer, I was just told that this happens and that it’s in the terms - so basically, pay your subscription and accept if it goes wrong, as a company, they’ll do little to help.  Once that week was up, I was simply told that they didn’t know where they’d gone and would try and get replacements. Bare in mind, both products are currently on the site as out of stock - something that they weren’t a few days ago which if ASOS had dealt with already, would of been with me. Didn’t even have the audacity to suggest pushing the orders quickly, but rather usual standard delivery if everything goes smoothly. It will not!","Dec 2, 2019"

Still yet to receive my gift card and unclear returns policy,Instead of receiving a refund I got a gift card instead. It was not made clear at all on the returns slip and given that it was a new change in Asos' policy I feel it should have been clearly stated on the slip that a refund would not be generated after 28 days to avoid customer confusion. I assumed 45 days would still follow the exact same returns policy procedure. If I had known I would have made sure to send the items back within 28 days.,"Dec 1, 2019"

Thanks Stuart,"Well I mean, ASOS itself is obviously great, massive selection yada yada yada, but this review is mainly for the customer service I just received. Although I was on hold on live chat for about 40 minutes before getting through to Stuart, it was black Friday weekend, and ASOS had reduced literally everything on their website, so I wasn't surprised. I thought multiple days worth of my orders had been cancelled as I'd had ominous emails sent my way, but Stuart reassured me that thankfully my ridiculous spending spree was still going to eat away at my credit card allowance. Thanks Stuart! Now, back to ASOS....","Dec 1, 2019"

The lady was obviously apologetic and i stressed i was not angry with her but the fact that i pay for next day delivery for a year and its not even bloody worth it when its likely going to come 5 days after delivering!!! understand its a busy time of year but 1 hour to get onto live chat is a joke and to find out my parcel hasnt even left the warehouse is an even bigger joke!!!","Dec 1, 2019"

Buyer beware,"Buyer beware, customer service is terrible if you have an issue with your order. Check, check and triple check your order. 3 extra units got added to my order for reasons I cannot explain. I tried to cancel within seconds of receiving the confirmation email but the system did not allow for cancellation. Then when I tried to get online help for someone to remove the extra items and at least issue me a credit so I could purchase something else (they claimed cancellation was impossible) they refused. Seems I will have to endure paying for duplicate items that I never intended to order. They know most won't bother sending them back as the international shipping cost at your own expense just adds to your losses. I wonder how many others were caught out with this same unscrupulous practice. Check the reviews and go with a more reputable company that is willing to correct errors with online ordering systems within minutes of placing the order. Will never use this company again.","Dec 1, 2019"
